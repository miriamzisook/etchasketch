Of course, Jacob and Nathan have school- Helen & Gil have jobs. Ben & Sophie have jobs- but really, I would have preferred any other time. Too bad, life & death things do not revolve around your issues.   \n  \nI raised you to have some flexibility- or so I thought.   \n  \nThis is not a plea for you to change your mind. You know what Papa would have wanted- he was a good influence on you. You are a better human being because he set standards that you may not have gotten any other way. He also set standards for how adults children behave.   \n  \nBe mindful. And as careful with other people’s needs. Hillel said: If I am not for myself who am I; if I am only for myself what am I. The balance is hard to get right. It’s a lifelong struggle. Give yourself time to really think about who you want to be- then just be that person.   \n  \nYou are going to be 29 years old. You are not a small child. You are whatever you choose to be. I think I cleared a path for you and gave you as many choices as a mommy could give...   \n  \nSo breathe- think- make your own decisions.   \n  \nPS: Cc’ing all 3 of you- maybe hold each other to better standards... I won’t be around forever.   \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nWell Aaron- your choice; no need to explain. But seriously, you are not that delicate. You may however be extremely selfish and unkind. \n\n  \n\n\nI am not the problem HERE. I made no demands on you when Papa died- you showed up. You were at family gatherings where grandchildren are expected and you had lovely relaxing accommodations in Palm Springs. \n\n  \n\n\nSo - don’t blame me for making unreasonable demands. It’s HIGH time you just stopped gaslighting me!   \n  \nYour inability to rise above your own issues shows a profound lack of maturity and character. \n\n  \n\n\nIt is NOT MY JOB to continue my pattern of making things “easy” for you at times when it is appropriate for you to rise to the challenge of being there for others. You use me and my friends to help you- with no regard for our feelings or needs. That reflects poorly on you. I won’t even mention what Papa would think if he could read your email- I think you know what he would say.   \n  \nI don’t expect you to understand now \n\nYou will think what you want- I can’t influence you. I don’t want to force you to be anywhere you don’t want to be. I’m just stunned by your willingness to compromise on doing the right thing because thevairpirts May be more crowded than usual. Bubbe chose the date specifically to accommodate YOUR work schedule. I can go ANY time. \n\n  \n\n\nAt a certain point you may want to consider just how extremely disappointed I am in MYSELF for not raising a kinder more thoughtful son.   \nWell- you had two parents, I could only do HALF- or less. It was an uphill battle. \n\n  \n\n\nConsidering Papa’s values- you really should just gather your thoughts and think about what his expectations would be. I have ALMOST none anymore. \n\n  \nIt is unimaginable to me that I would have missed my grandparents ANYTHING, for MY OWN COMFORT. Do you understand??? \n\n  \nAnyway, If you came to PSP and repeated your meltdown performance - it would be an unpleasant reflection on you and another reminder of how I failed. \n\n  \n\n\nMy parents and I are the reasons you had many advantages- we also set a GREAT example of grace under extreme pressure. Beyond that, YOU ARE AN ADULT. I hope that your children, if you have them, are there for you when I die. I think you might be surprised to realize -when it’s too late - that You we’re lucky I was your mother. I was raised “right” and have the hard-won dignity to finally tell you that I don’t deserve your continued abuse & neglect. ALL I WANT is to know you have the capacity to be the best possible human being. You must want that for yourself. \n\n  \nI am hitting send- I am going to enjoy my time in Indianapolis more productively. AND I don’t want to spend another minute being gaslighted by you and Miriam.   \n  \nSo, if this sounds harsh- it is.   \nYou are a better/finer person than you give yourself credit for. \n\n  \n\n\nI would of course appreciate your gentle support. Losing my father was very difficult- especially when my closest “people” were not “there” for me. \n\n  \nWhen you are ready to be a mensch- lmk- I will always be here for you.   \n  \nLove, mommy \n\n  \n\n\nPS: Papa would be disappointed in you. Remember when he scolded you when he observed your disrespect. I hope his legacy means SOMETHING to you in the future. \n\n  \n\n",

Bubbe and I went together to say Kaddish- it was wonderful & friendly- I may just go there for the High Holidays. \n\n  \n\n\nIt would be great if you could come see where I live. But, maybe just having a talk will be good- that will be all the celebration I need. \n\n  \n\n\nFor now- just let me know if you think of me sometimes- I think about you. \n\n  \n\n\nHope you are loving your work. \n\n  \n\n\nPlease keep in touch whatever way you want.

When you got home, little and adorable, dresses in your red white & blue “doll dress” you came running over to me as excited and full of wonder as you always were... but with great urgency... you flew into my arms...and that’s what you said. You were only 23 months old. You weighed about 21 pounds. Most kids that age don’t even speak in sentences, but you were already a poet! \n\n  \n\n\nAnyway, I miss my little girl... and my grownup daughter. Maybe one day... \n\n  \n\n\nBubbe is coming tomorrow to visit for a few weeks. I want to make her smile... she’s been so sad lately. \n\n  \n\n\nI hear through the grapevine that you got a wonderful new job- can you tell me about it, or send a link? \n\n  \n\n\nAnyway, I know we’ll connect sometime. When you’re ready, I’m here... or there. \n\n  \n\n\nThings are good, I am loving my beautiful little garden... it’s a certified Monarch Waystation!! Imagine that! Yesterday I picked a Zuchini the size of a small watermelon. I inherited this garden, so now I’m gardening- who knew?- and loving it.

I could be a great party -planner or get a job as a para-pro. Lots to think about- i’ll Want your advice about starting a career, since you will be the grown-ups in this situation! \n\n  \n\n\nAnyway, i come from strong survivor “stock” it sucks, what your dad did and continues to do to me, but maybe he will be good to you. I’m finally getting some perspective- & happier than i’ve been since you kids were little and I could throw my whole self into being Mommy. \n\n  \n\n\nI lsuppose things would be easier now if I dudn’t Abruptly end “my career” in July, 1987 the morning I went into pre-term labor... I was planning to go back to a “stellar” exciting career!!! \n\n  \n\n\nI may not always have had the strength to raise 4 kids (yes 4) and still be a daughter, friend, community-person, but once I was going to “just” be a mom, I wanted to be good at it. In order for me to succeed, I needed you to be launched into adulthood as HAPPY & RESOURCEFUL as you could be. \n\n  \n\n\nI’m not sure when Miriam graduates, Ben will in a few weeks... so I’ll have three kids with Masters Degrees, all doing what they love to do. Not bad for me... i’ll call that career success!!! I’m proud of all of you. REALLY REALLY PROUD! \n\n  \n\n\nI hope you are as proud of yourselves as I am. I also know that at your age you have existential issues that keep you on your toes. Just keep following your DREAMS. You can do it ALL. I may have given up on my career to easily- but it nice to have the luxury of just being Mommy!!! \n\n  \n\n\nWe can all look back at the mistakes- but what’s the point- that’s just another mistake. \n\n  \n\n\nYou have one mommy... I only have you three. \n\n  \n\n\nI’m a lot more fun when I don’t have to raise you, but I hope you will think of me lovingly the way I think of my parents and cherish our time, which I now know can be too short... \n\n  \n\n\nSo, one last look back... it’s Sunday May 27th 2018.... \n\n  \n\n\n34 years ago, at this hour I was a hopeful, excited bride... I was about to Take a bath and start getting ready for my wedding. It was sunny & 80ish degrees. I sat in my parent’s back yard with Papa. He gave me Papa advice and I cried... I told him I still wanted to be a little girl... he said he would always be my Daddy. And he was. \n\n  \n\n\nWe had a beautiful wedding surrounded by loving family and friends. I lived your father and wanted him to be happy. \n\n  \n\n\nI don’t know when things went wrong- or what your perceptions were about my marriage, but I thought I kept you safe and as happy as kids could be. If there were lapses- there always are in families. \n\n  \n\n\nI trusted your father and as far as I know he was good and honest until something snapped- around when he went to work for Citadel. \n\n  \n\n\nAnyway- revisiting my 34th Anniversary is making me a little sad that I don’t have the relationships I imagined I would back then... \n\n  \n\n\nI dreamed of stability, happy healthy kids who tolerated me... grandkids (one day)... a career... \n\n  \n\n\nJust saying... I miss you all so, so much!!! \n\n  \n\n\nLovelovelove, \n\nMommy \n\n  \n\n\nPS: \n\nNothing would make me happier than hearing about you from YOU. \n\n  \n\n\nTell me stuff- just current events... i’ll Keep your “boundaries” if you keep mine. \n\n  \n\n\nI want to hear about Miriam’s graduation & future plans... Aaron’s romance?! \n\n  \n\n\nI like to think that your success reflects well on me- just a little- you are all way more accomplished than I was... I was younger than Ben age when I took MY MASTERS DEGREE from U of C & followed Albert to Boston for HIS career. No complaints, that’s what I wanted. Gil was in Boston- it was close to NY... I thrives in Boston- had the beginning of a stellar career!!! \n\n  \n\n\nMaybe just write and tell me what’s happening in your lives... \n\n  \n\n\nS&B, you get a pass on the writing- M & A - something?? Anything??? Aaron, I hear Amy is pretty and makes you happy... \n\n  \n\n\ni’ll See you maybe?? at Ben’s graduation! \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nDear kids, \n\nPlease do not trash talk me for being sentimental. If I could write a poem that would cling to the last page of the Haggadah I would... but then I would have had a career as a poet... and then ... as papa would say (with a twinkle in his eyes...) “then Nitzaleh- you wouldn’t have been a school bus!” \n\n  \n\n\nSo Darling b’nei Nitza Bat Arieh v’Ilana: \n\n  \n\n\nYou know how much Papa enjoyed Pesach... he lit up listening to the BiG EPiC story. He loved watching his little piece of the story of his People unfold before his eyes. \n\n  \n\n\nPapa lived his own struggle to cross a dessert to a promised land. The story of Ilana & Arieh is as hopeful a reminder of what’s important as any biblical story. Really... what exactly did Abraham do that papa did not? Papa actually crossed that same dessert (oK on a plane... ) and then he defended the Sinai from Egyptian attacks... and he made it to two “promissed” lands. He held four of his grandsons at their brisses and lived to see one marry. Even Abraham at 100 didn’t have 2 great grandchildren. \n\n  \n\n\nI hope that this Pesach when you open the door for Elijah you feel other visitors at your table. I hope you feel my pride that you are each celebrating Passover joyfully in places all over. Think of how proud my father would be. \n\n  \n\n\nOne way or another, Papa was determined that we would all gather to celebrate this Pesach together. \n\n  \n\n\nIt would take a miracle now and since I only believe in virtual miracles- like the 🐸 on the Pesach table... let’s be together... virtually.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nDear Kids: i’ll Tell you a secret... all those years of Pesach Seders were for my Daddy. I made them so he would be proud of me and hopeful for my future. \n\n  \n\n\nGrandma Nancy couldn’t make a Seder this year. But remember the Seders of your childhoods and ones you were too young to even remember... with endless beautiful tables and love. Think of how proud Nancy woul be to see you so joyful. \n\n  \n\n\nI hope you remember those moments with Grandma Nancy and Papa. \n\n  \n\n\nPapa would want you all to carry his spirit, if not his name forward.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nSo you will. \n\n  \n\n\nHappy Pesach! \n\n  \n\n\nNext Year in Jerusalem \n\n  \n\n\nLove, \n\nMommy \n\n  \n\n\nPS: I was lying in bed thinking of “overnighting” papa’s clothing for you to wear at each of your Seders; I’m big on the “multi sensory” learning-thing, but papa would tell me “not to waste the money... next year we’ll do it... “ \n\n  \n\n\nso I wrote you a letter instead. \n\n  \n\n\nPapa had big hands... you had little hands... so during the three hour meal... just imagine him at the door with Elijah. \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "Hi kids-   \n  \nPapa just sailed through his second “procedure” of the day. They just did outpatient surgery to put a chemo-port central iV in his chest. Everything’s fine.   \nPhew... it has been a long day for your cute grandparents.   \n  \nI talked to Bubbe a bunch of times. She had “shpilkes” sitting there all day, but she feels fine - except for being restless ... ya know- imagine Bubbe waiting all day...   \n  \nThey got to the hospital around 10 am and they’re still there. Normally the hospital (Eisenhower Hospital) runs like clockwork but they shoehorned papa in today so he could start chemo sooner- and be done sooner.   \n  \nBubbe & Papa have a good routine. Papa is chillin’ Bubbe worries enough for the two of them.   \n  \nThey should be cleared to go home any minute- Gil is trying to convince them get a cab/Lyft (yes , M LYFT!)   \n  \nSo, one long tough day in the tear-view mirror.   \n  \nCheck in with B & P tomorrow. They have a day off tomorrow and then 6 hours of Chemo on Friday. Gil   \nIs going to be there on Friday night and Saturday.   \n  \nI hope you don’t mind the group email - Bubbe seemed really tired- she’ll tell you all about it tomorrow.   \n  \nLove,   \nMommy   \n  \nPS: i told papa that this was one of the less desirable ways to get one, But he has his own port now.   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n",

I would like to support you in little ways, when I can, but maybe in this small way (having you pay a bill for a service that I get no benefit from) I will send you a signal that I am not limitless in my kindness! \n\n  \n\n\nMiriam, I do worry that you are making a choice to cut me off. I could be a wonderful resource for you. But if that is what you want, I will heal. I don't know how to leave the door open without exposing myself to more hurt than I deserve. I love you, you are my daughter... I can't imagine what could be bothering you that merits this response- I can only imagine that you are in a dark place that may or may not have something to do with me. If there is something that I need to know that you can't tell me directly, you can have your therapist call me... or involve one of your brothers. We are a family. \n\n  \n\n\nLove, mom \n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nThat was very articulate and gentle. I think I understand now- really. Honestly, I think we both need thicker skins! And to understand each other' defense mechanisms. I am angry & I was very hurt, and still am. My comment about picking me apart with your therapist was uncalled for but probably a paranoid response to what I perceive as a demonization of ME. It's hard to see myself as abusive- I don't think I'm mean, generally- but I can be defensive. If you look at our correspondence, you may see patterns that we both need to break.   \nNow that we are closer to the crux of the issue, I would like to try to do better- if you will too. I'm sorry that you perceive me as abusive; that's a tough pill to take. The last thing I would ever want is for you to be hurt or damaged. I can try to not cause further hurts. I can also try to fix the damage. If I had known that you were so afraid of my defensiveness I could have done a better job of redirecting myself. That said, I was fairly stunned at what I perceived as a lack of empathy. I think both of us are having perceptual problems. Mother's and daughters get better with practice. A practical therapist would tell us to just practice, but considering your fear, I actually think if I come to your therapist's office for coaching, we could make a plan. In my defense, you could not hear me when I wrote, my actual voice may have betrayed my own hurt and sensitivity- think of my tone when I say \"it's pick on mommy day\". It's different- but maybe harder to perceive.   \n  \n  \nI have a sardonic side that protects myself- I don't think of myself as mean. But I will have to be more tender and careful with my baby girl. I love you,   \n\n",

I understand you just went through something difficult with Brian, I hope the sailing is smoother now. \n\n  \n\n\nMy hope with the therapists was that we could get closer. My fear much of the time is that the other shoe will drop, and you will hurt me. When you write \"have fun picking me apart with your therapist. I guess you couldn't bother to actually set goals and parameters for your invasion of my privacy\" and flippantly and sarcastically call my wish to find a way to connect with you an attack instead, it hurts me. When you accuse me of being toxic, poisonous, or a narcissist it hurts me. Your sarcasm and accusations cause me to back away. When I interact with you I am always feeling afraid of the next mean thing you'll say. If you want me to feel I can draw closer to you you have to stop saying hurtful, mean shit when you're upset. Afterwards you often say something like \"I shouldn't have said that.\" But that isn't an apology and it doesn't erase the hurt and it doesn't protect me from next time. \n\n  \n\n\nLove \n\nMiriam \n\n  \n\n",

What are you saying?   \n  \nI firmly believe that the potential gain from having our therapists talk is outweighed by the risk of further harm. I know what my therapist thinks about our situation. I know what I've told him. You probably know what your therapist would advise.   \n  \nLast time I set parameters was with Molly and you obtained more information than you or I wanted you to have.   \n  \nYou have set the rules for over two years. I would like to move on but I have some boundaries too.   \n  \nBrian (someone I have come to love and care deeply about) is having brain surgery on December 30th; so, as you see now, that date is not arbitrary. Did you really just assume I set an arbitrary deadline? Why would you assume the that I am gaslighting you without asking me for clarification?   \n  \nI do want to move on. You have been critical of the way I write- maybe we can just talk to each other. I don't think I am toxic and I continue to be very hurt by your intimation that I am dangerous to you. Think about what you are saying by repeatedly implying that you don't trust me to have a normal mother-daughter talk. What exactly do you risk? Do you risk more than I do? I am recovering from a very rough few years during which I said things that I regret- what else can I say? My motivations have been good and I tried to put your needs ahead of mine. We would both be enriched by having a cordial relationship.   \n  \nMiriam, neither of us is completely blameless. I think we would benefit from having a conversation together- if you feel that an initial ice-breaker needs to be mediated, I can visit, like I said, in your therapists office.

(I leave on 10/3 at 9:30 pm.   \nI don't want to be hasty with my reply.   \nI'm glad you explained. Obviously, I love you more than anything and I didn't mean to say hurtful things- I hope we can begin there.   \n  \nI think we're/are in uncharted mother-daughter territory   \n  \nI think you took very good care of me. I did feel, and still do, that you were critical of me and my choices almost immediately after Dad left. I was so touched, and still am that you cared enough about me to miss an important week of school & I was so proud of how you took care of everything, including your Google presentation, AND ME so competently. BUT: If I had it to do over again, I would have begged you not to come.   \n  \nNo daughter should have to go through what you went through. I would have protected you better if I had known what would unfold over the next few days, months... YEARS. I was shocked and very broken. It took months of weekly and sometimes daily therapy to get through the legal discovery in our divorce. During that time I couldn't absorb what was happening. I was lucky & unlucky that all of you kids were old enough to understand. On one hand, you were able to be supportive; on the other, I didn't have a clue about how knowing the details would affect you. I had no idea what the situation was. I wanted to be open and honest with you.   \n  \nI also asked you many questions about what you might have known. That was a mistake that I regret.   \n  \nI still don't know what the proper balance of need-to-know vs. need-to-tell should be. I should have known sooner that I shouldn't have told you anything that you didn't ask me to tell you. I felt like you couldn't even imagine the questions. I also thought that you might have knowledge or insight that I didn't have. I also wanted to make it clear that what was happening to our family was not my fault or yours. I thought that Dad was mentally ill and needed attention. I never could have imagined the reality I had been living in. I would have protected myself and you better if I had known.   \n  \nIn the first few weeks of December 2013, I also thought there would be a way to help Dad and wanted to keep us all engaged and talking to each other and to him.   \n  \nMiriam, you were way quicker than me to understand how fraught our situation was. I think I told you over a year ago that I respected your decision to not \"talk.\" I also respected your space/time and even though it hurt me deeply that you didn't trust me, I tried to always put YOUR needs ahead of mine.   \n  \nPlease don't blame me for things I wrote while we weren't speaking. This medium is hard. So, another mistake was trying to write spontaneously and from my heart-   \n  \nAt the start, you were pretty bossy about my communication with Dad. I needed to keep an open dialog in those first few days and it helped a lot to have the little information I had- emotionally, and for obvious reasons in the disposition of my case.   \nI wanted and needed you to respect my judgment and decisions.   \n  \nI am told, and believe for myself that I comported myself well throughout the divorce. I am proud of how strong I am. My only unfinished business is now with you, so it would help me a great deal to move forward with you. I think it's time. You have no idea how hard the last three years have been for me- or how you hurt me, likewise, I can't go back and walk in your shoes.   \n  \nSo Miriam, I really don't know why we are having such a hard time being understanding and compassionate with each other. I want to try to get things right, or at least- better.   \n  \nKindest regards & love, \nMom",

You keep asking me what's \"eating me\" and then you don't seem to believe my answer. \n\n  \n\n\nI understand that now that it's been so long since we talked, you feel justified in being so angry. But, you didn't start saying these things to me after we stopped talking, you started saying them to me almost immediately after dad left. Even when I had just spent 3 out of the first 4 weeks at home with you, was answering every single phone call and text immediately, even if it meant rushing out of class and meetings, you still felt these intense feelings that I was abandoning you, that I was criticizing you, that I was treating you like dad, that I was trying to control or punish you. If I did something that upset you it seemed you would go to this angry place and just bombard me with these hurtful words.  You tell me I'm toxic, angry, a narcissist, like dad, I am not worthy of being your daughter.  Afterwards, you seem not to really remember what you said, or believe me when I say how hurtful it was. \n\n  \n\n\nThere's no big dark secret I'm keeping about why I'm upset with you, I'm upset with you because of now 3 years of calls, texts and emails like the one you sent Tuesday, or in Palm Springs, or after I saw you for ben's concert in Michigan, or when I told you I didn't want to know what Scott told you about dad. When you're angry with me you explode, sending pages of hostile rambling hurtful words. You also did it when they were spoken in person or over the phone.  you. I wish with my whole heart you could recognize the power you have as my mom to hurt me when you say these things to me. \n\n  \n\n\nI have worked so hard to rebuild a relationship with you, trying to tell you more about my life and by coming to dinner when I was in Chicago, or by coming to Palm Springs for Bubbe's birthday, but all you can see is the idea I'm punishing you by keeping my distance, and the same kinda of messages keep coming.  At this point I just don't know what to do. I have run out of hope that you can see your own behavior, and I have run out of hope that you can control it. \n\n  \n\n\nA next possible step is if your therapist would speak with my therapist. If that's something you're open to, he can email me to get her contact information. \n",

As you know Miriam has refused to talk to me in person for well over a year.   \nExcuse me for sounding harsh, but please try to see this (unnecessary) drama from my perspective. Miriam showed kindness coming to town when dad left me- where was that kindness when I needed support after the divorce? I could have used your support and thoughts as I reestablish myself and we find the new normal for our family.   \nI have been overly considerate of each of you- it has reached a point of pain now. You can't take & take and never give.   \nI hope Saturday is a good time to reflect.   \nMiriam, I spoke with the therapist per your \"ultimatum\".

Have you checked in with your therapist??   \n  \nIn all honesty, I don't like this situation precisely because everything else in my life seems very well balanced and joyful.   \n  \nMiriam, I'm just pleading with you- if you won't tell me what's eating you, and you won't listen to ME- I really don't think I can continue this nonsense. I get tired of telling people you won't actually talk to me- it's exhausting and I can't answer the inevitable WHY? (It's not that it's embarrassing, though it is, it's a pain I don't need to experience on a daily basis.) I deserve to be happy now. I gave up a lot to get here.   \n  \nIf you didn't want to talk to me you could have sent a polite text. I laid myself bare and told all of you that it was important for me to talk with you because you are my only next of kin(s). Maybe you don't understand the seriousness of that role- and the sacrifices I make for you.   \n  \nAlso, I don't understand: why did you get on a plane when dad left and are willing to trample my joy in finally being free now?? Miriam, do you at least see how this command-control behavior is just too familiar to me?? he has the impression that you are possibly exhibiting some learned patterns that I should avoid.   \n  \nSo yes, my therapist advises that I set strict limits with you. He says to tell you the truth, that I love you, you are my daughter, but focus on my good relationships.   \n  \nIf you want to stick to superficial chit-chat in texts , fine. I think I resolved my big issues about medical wishes, end of life wishes, and the disposition of my property without hearing you. I doubt I'll need to speak personally for a while.   \n  \nI love you. I can't not love you. I'm sure it is frustrating you that I don't understand your motivation for not talking directly to me. Maybe if you would take the time to write... Telling me that I \"don't HEAR you\" will be laughable under the circumstances.   \n  \nBTW: if you are honest with your therapist and show them my emails... they may help put me in a better light.   \n  \nIf you want to give me more of your thoughts, I will at least have something to talk to my therapist about.   \n  \nSo, Mir, you have a ball in your court, all yours, you are in control, what r YOU wanting out of this relationship?   \n  \nPeace- love- understanding-   \nMom   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n",

I will write \"urgent\" in emails that require immediate attention.   \n  \nI had hoped for some kindness around the sensitive/emotional issues of my estate and medical planning. I tried to set things up to minimize YOUR stress should I be incapacitated or dead. The questions I had were so that I could better take your concerns into consideration. Absent your responses, I made the best decisions I could.   \n  \nMy attorney Joe Zarlenga at Lawrence, Kamin, Saunders& Uhlenhop of 300 South Wacker in Chicago will have my Will, trust, and medical wishes on file. Gil will be the executor of my Estate while he is able, and Aaron will be the \"sub.\" Lora Green will hold a medical Power of Attorney while she is able, Aaron will be the \"sub.\"   \n  \nI was told to talk to my children about my medical wishes in particular. I tried reaching out to you to do this. There is never going to be a \"good\" time for this conversation. I wanted to talk to you before I signed my documents today.   \n  \nI hope you will be relieved that I chose Lori to have a medical power of attorney. Obviously, you can't imagine me incapacitated but I know what it's like to have a parent in an unexpected medical crisis, I want systems in place for Since I don't have a spouse. I want you to have the advice and counsel of Lori & Rabbi Gordon.   \n  \nIn addition to my Estate plan, I have a long term care insurance policy that will cover hospitalization, nursing, & home care. I also did this out of respect for your time and stages in life. I don't expect you to appreciate the potential impact of my having an illness on your busy lives, I do want you to appreciate that I DO NOT want to disrupt your lives - not just saying that- the policy is very expensive and completely elective.   \n  \nYou are all young adults I am only 57 and hope to live to be 120; these decisions only effect you in the short term, if a calamity happens. That said, the TRUST & WILL have potential for easing your stress down the road. So without belaboring the point- I made legal decisions with YOUR WELFARE as my PRIMARY CONCERN. I don't expect much in thanks but a return phone call is NOT UNCALLED FOR.   \n  \nI am proud of the way I conduct myself. I have bent over backwards to give you \"soft landings\" after my divorce. I may not have been 100% perfect. With few exceptions - I have been gracious. I have learned to play by your rules... I need to establish my rules now.   \n  \nI apologize for things I said angrily or thoughtlessly- I can't take things I said back/ just do the best I can in the future. You should each THINK bout how your actions and words have impacted me.   \n  \nAs I said before, I don't expect much- just basic decency and kindness.   \n  \nTelling me I am too \"unsafe,\" or worse, that you can't be bothered to listen, especially if I have important questions that involve you, during your busy lives- I will take as unkind.   \n  \nI know you are all busy and absorbed in THE IMPORTANT WORK OF GROWING UP. I am too, yet, I somehow have always been there for you... Again, you are adults. Relationships are two-ways. I have limits and boundaries too.   \n  \nI love you all.   \n  \nMom   \n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

The following is a rant- I am angry, I am not married, I have friends-many, but they do not count legally. , you are my next of kin.   \n  \nMiriam, you were so outraged when I called you on your manipulative behavior in PSP... Hmmm. Are you manipulating me into thinking I am the toxic partner? I know from experience that a real narcissist will never know or admit it. They are the grandma-Merles, the Ruthys, the Alberts. It's always someone else's fault!! You have tried to cast me in the role that dad cast me in. Reactive, unstable... Go ahead, tell yourself that story. I know it isn't true. I know what I told you about reading the depositions from my divorce. I know what I told my lawyers to tell you when YOU ASKED for them. I spoke with Molly again, she said she did what she could to discourage you. If that is really what you are angry about- get over it. You wanted to read them.   \n  \nI am angry this morning. If I don't tell you or write this down, the wound could get infected...   \n  \nHere goes:   \nI think it's NOT too much to ask for you to pick up a phone and call me if I plead and say it's important to talk. You have crossed so many lines with me, this could be the last straw. I don't want to text you about my property WILL and I especially don't want to fucking text about my medical WILL.. Are you really that unkind? if so, I will protect myself from you.   \n  \nAre you a narcissist?   \nCan I have any confidence that you will ever behave as a daughter? You have shown little empathy for me for two years. I can't consider your feelings forever if you have no regard for mine.   \n  \nIf you have a narcissistic streak, you will always blame me and manipulate me, if you do not, the relationship will seem right. Our relationship does not seem right. You asked me for support and attention, I have been there for you. You also asked Dad for financial help. I hope he was able to give you what you asked him for.   \n  \nI am not a narcissist. I am a gentle kind person who deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. You have behaved poorly- acting like the aggrieved party... We are all trying to heal. None of us knew what dad was capable of. I was, and still am, too good natured to see evil in others. I am reminding myself that I should not take good for granted. Some people are unkind. Are you one of them?   \n  \nI'm sorry to text, email... but your behavior is not healthy for me. I am tired of being treated like toxic waste. You are lucky to have me for a mother.   \n  \nI'm also sorry that I had no idea your father was incapable of empathy or honesty. He put up a good act... He convinced-even me - that he was the honest, good natured parent. He did a real number on you kids.   \nAbout my Will:   \nLora Green will be my medical proxy. Gil will execute my will. Aaron will make financial decisions if Gil can't. Currently, you are the back-up for Lori on my medical decisions. I will have to change that.   \nYour brothers have shown good character through a very difficult time in my life. You have not. Your constant acts of \"self protection\" are odd and seem unbalanced and selfish under the circumstances.   \n  \nIf you had had the courtesy to call, or text back when I said it was important, I wouldn't be as panicked about you being selfish... What can I say? You surely will understand why I am the one who needs to protect myself!!   \nI shared this note with the boys- don't divide & conquer. I would rather have no relationship with you, than one that causes me this much anxiety.   \nI love you, you are my daughter but I can't be exposed to your level of insensitivity.   \nIf I am wrong to think you are showing narcissistic tendencies, feel free to try to convince me through your deeds, that you are not.   \nObviously, this is not a conversation we should be having by text... I am playing by Your rules...   \nAll three of you will need to get to know ME. You have no idea who I am. I had no idea how oppressed I was.   \nI am finally seeing how I should have been more assertive before. Please don't judge me for this, or things I write. I prefer to talk but Miriam insists on being protected from me. I am not mean. If I have said mean things- we all have...   \n  \nEnough Miriam. It's high time you prove yourself worthy of being my daughter.   \n  \nSorry for the harshness. I want you to know that you crossed a line.   \n  \nI thought it was important to discuss my wishes with you before signing my will. I am legally alone. I have wonderful relationship with Brian but he is not my next-of-kin. If I can't rely on you to call in an emergency- I need to know.   \n  \nOK, I don't want to spend another minute being disappointed and aggravated... Too much to do...   \n  \nI sincerely hope I am wrong, that you are the kind, & loving person you always seemed to be- you - after all, will understand why I need to keep my guard up.   \n  \nLove,   \nMom   \n  \n  \n\n",

I hurt you in the past; you have been unkind to me for a long enough time.- I can't change things I said, I certainly can't change your perceptions. I also can't promise that I will never disappoint you again. I am trying to get past the past.   \n  \nDo I really need to keep hearing about how I hurt you?? You are going to be 29 years old. Life is complicated. You are lucky to have me for a mother. I think your behavior toward me is arbitrary since you have no idea what I went through.. If you I insist on seeing the negative when there is so much positive to be grateful for, you are dragging yourself down. If you can't see plainly what a gift I could be in your life, I will just have to understand and move on.   \n  \nThe trip in August would be a kindness - and I didn't ask for myself. I can't speak for them, but I think your brothers want OUR family to heal. Your selfishness in this regard is surprising to me; we are all trying, and no one is perfect. I don't mean to add stress, but I want to turn a page in my life. I have wonderful sustaining relationships with people who treasure my friendship but my relationship with you is a source of pain that you have seized control over.   \n  \nI prefer NOT TO WRITE but I've played by your rules for over a year. I have rules too. I expect civility and kindness. Your last email was, unkind. I don't want to respond harshly but I need to protect myself as well. Constantly being told that I am toxic is not helpful to me, I also think my good far outweighs my bad and it's really time for you to recognize the gift I can be for you.   \n  \nI asked you to come in August for grandma Nancy and Zayde- perhaps you are not aware of how fragile Nancy is. Zayde will be 82-   \nLife is short.   \n  \nIf we can just agree not to persist in this negative pattern, I think we can have fun together and share the good things. I have plenty of good news that I'd like to share with you, but only if I can trust YOU to understand and be happy for me. I have always tried my best to make your happiness the biggest priority in my life. I care about you- you are my baby-girl, but this relationship goes two ways and if you insist on constantly repeating how I mis-handled YOU without thought of your mistakes, or my feelings, we can't move off this spot...   \n  \nLike I said, I don't want to write. I don't express myself well this way and it's too easy to be misunderstood.   \n  \nBe happy, do what it takes to be happy, but please consider how you may be roadblock to others at this moment.   \n  \nI promise not to bite if you come. I want you to have some TLC from your mommy and bond with MY new home.   \n  \nSorry if I am saying wrong words.

Think about you when I'm winding down... Glad ur ok. I didn't mean to make you jealous, just feeling like I'll think of you there. I remember how excited you were when you saw them- anyway, generally, I'm even jealous of myself about how nicely things are turning out and how good my days are!   \nAnother fun thing I did, watch the \"real people\" Cinderella- I made Brian watch it because he needed to get my cultural references. Then I showed him pictures of you in the Lesley Anne Warren costume. I didn't drag him to the basement to see the actual tiny little gown! (Yup, still Brian... I think you'll approve)   \nDo I sound a little mushy? I'm feeling like a mom today... I noticed on my phone bill that your data is down and you are due for a phone upgrade. I think you \"rent\" the phones now so you can upgrade and add to the bill. I think you may be in need of a little spoiling. No strings, I loved it when B&P gave me little windfalls... I still do.   \nSorry so mushy... I had such a nice morning.   \nAlso, my darling sweet daughter, you probably don't even know/remember what I'm like if I'm actually happy... I can be very funny and fun. The girlfriends are noticing a change...   \nAnyway to quote Joni Mitchell:   \n\"I feel unfettered and alive...\"   \nAnd since I'm completely free-associating: I went looking for the CD you made me when you left for CMU. Do you have the burn-file? Can you send it?   \nAlso, I talk about you to Brian - I wanted to play him the CD. I don't think he can understand me without getting to know you.

   "Message preview": "\n\nHi Mom, \n\n  \n\n\nThanks for your reply. I can tell you took time to calm down, and I appreciate that you discussed it with your therapist and apologized for your part in making the interaction challenging. I would really love it if you can always try to put off writing when you're upset and your buttons are pushed. When you write to me after you've taken some time to calm down your responses are a lot easier for me to deal with. I am sorry you feel abandoned and criticized by me, it has been really hard for me to find a way to show you I love you and care about you and want to support you (which I really really do) that enables me to have the boundaries I need to feel good in my life. When I don't write back when you're sending me a lot of messages, I'm trying to be sure I only wrote to you from a calm place, which is something I wish we could both do better. \n\n  \n\n\nYou told me that when I say \"I'm done\" it really hurts you. You say that to me very frequently, and it really hurts me too. You also told me it hurts you when I compare you to dad. It really hurts me when you do it to me. I don't think you realize the power of your hurtful words as my mother. Even though you sometimes say \"we both say things we don't mean\" I need you to remember that when you are in the heat of the moment and say a hurtful thing, you can't actually undo it. If you recognize your own struggle with trust and abandonment, then please recognize too that Ben and Aaron and I are struggling through the deep emotional price of being abandoned by our father, and we can be triggered in the same ways as you can. \n\n  \n\n\nWhen you express that you think I'm \"hateful\",\"poisonous\", \"toxic\", \"narcissistic\", \"like dad\", \"chilling\", \"scary\" \"without empathy\" \"unable to take the position of the other\" \"manipulative\" or any of those other \"choice words\" your therapist reprimanded you about I feel horrible. It's heartbreaking to believe that's the person your mom believes you are. \n\n  \nAs far as California for Nathan's bar mitzvah, I know you're upset I am not coming. I need you to remember that I am an adult and even when you wish I would make a different choice, it's my choice. When you get so angry I'm not coming it makes me feel like my life isn't of any interest to you. I work 6 days a week most weeks and I'm docked pay for missing days and it causes challenges for a lot of other people when I'm not there. I need to be judicious about how often I travel, especially with weddings and other events coming up. It's a huge ordeal for me to travel across country for a 36 hour turnaround, and have to wake up at 6 to work a 10 hour day on either side of the trip. It's not just about the ticket price or the lost work. It doesn't help that you can so easily get triggered and feel abandoned and say things you don't mean that really hurt me, but that isn't the only reason. I wish when I tell you I can't be there you could be proud of how hard I work or sympathetic with the fact that my life is really demanding, instead of responding by telling me I'm punishing you or Nathan, or that I am a bad family member with bad values. \n\n  \n\n\nI really hope we can find a way to get onto a better path together \n\n  \n\n\nLove, \n\nMiriam \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

FYI, my instruction to Molly about the depositions was to discourage you from ever reading them. She says she tried to, very hard, but that you told her it was important to you- very important- to know the truth. You did not tell her I encouraged you because Molly knows I did NOT ever want you to read them. \n\n  \n\n\nPeople tell themselves the stories that work in their schemes. Empathy is seeing the story from the other's perspective. I am trying to see your perspective. I am not sure you are able to see mine- yet, or ever. If you read between the lines of your own story you seem to put your own needs way ahead of anyone else's. Really, you felt the need to slink off without me knowing the you read my texts. You think I wouldn't understand if you replied that you wanted to take a walk... It was your missed opportunity, I thought it would be nice to spoil you a little and let you regress into being a little girl. Your ability to make things black or white is not helping you, or our relationship. \n\n  \n\n\nI do want to move on, but only when I feel empathy and love coming upstream from you. \n\n  \n\n\nBFD: I talked about my boyfriend - not as much as you imply, I was careful... and all you could do is think about yourself- why not be happy for your mom, who may actually have found love after years of misery.

Remember: \"the world was created for me\" v \"I AM nothing but dust\". Neither is true, where you locate yourself in the continuum is important. I'm trying to stay centered and balanced. \n\n  \n\n\nIf I share about my boyfriend it is because feeling loved and supported for the first time is a BIG DEAL after living with a narcissist for my entire adult life. I AM ALSO NOT THE SAME PERSON YOU STOPPED TALKING TO TWO YEARS AGO. I have had a few experiences that brought me  back to my true north. Living with your father, I was abused, beaten down... You could try to get your head around that. \n\n  \n\n\nI suggest you read your own words for instances of selfishness.

   "Message preview": "Hi mom, \n\n  \n\n\nYou keep asking me for a way forward, and I really don’t know what to say. I wrote this summary of our weekend in Palm Springs for my therapist. I’m sure you will see it completely differently from me, but **this is my experience** . \n\n  \n\n\nBefore you blow up at me about how I am skewing and distorting everything to make you look bad, and seeing everything through a lens where I am trying to vilify you, I think it would be a really good idea for you to look at this document really closely with your therapist, or a friend who is good with this kind of thing, and really try to understand it from my point of view. Don’t just tell me why I’m wrong and none of this is what you meant, and everyone says things they don’t mean. \n\n  \n\n\nLook particularly at the things you wrote to Aaron about me. How could I want someone in my life who would say that about me? Would you want to spend time with someone who treated you the way you treated me that weekend? \n\n  \n\n\nMiriam \n\n  \n\n\n——————————————— \n\n  \n\n\nFriday my mom came and sat with me on the patio at my grandparents' house and wanted to talk. She asked me about my life, but each time I answered she pivoted to talking about her boyfriend. At first it was ok, but at some point she asked if I was dating, and I said no. And she asked if that was important to me, and I said something along the lines of \"well, it's starting to be, but so much good stuff has happened for me this year that I haven't felt like it was the priority really\" and I was really hoping she'd ask me what I meant and what had happened this year, but she didn't, she just told me more about her boyfriend. I was friendly, but left the conversation asap. \n\n\\------ \n\nThen, at the hotel later I was in her room (I shared with Aaron) and she, Aaron and I were talking. It came up and I couldn't help myself, I asked if she knew how old Shan chan (dad's wife) was. She said she didn't, but had heard between 28-32. I asked where those numbers came from since I didn't remember her age in the depositions. She acted super surprised I'd read the depositions and was all concerned. I said it was her who encouraged me to read them and arranged for me to get them, and she said that wasn't true. I also said I didn't understand why she wanted me to read them, because they don't make her look that great, but didn't say what I meant and she didn't ask. She said she didn't want me to read them and that's why I had to get them from her lawyers, because she wouldn't give them to me. I got a little mad (externally, internally I had steam coming out of my ears) and pushed back that she had encouraged me and said that I needed to know the truth. She kept saying she hadn't and then when Aaron also pushed back she decided \"well, yea, I guess I said if you didn't want to know the truth now I was moving on and not answering questions later, so you had to ask for the truth now. But I wanted you to talk to me, not read the depositions.\" I said that was absolutely not true and had the emails to prove it. Aaron stood up for me and said she had said the same things to him. I left the room before it escalated further. \n\n  \n\n\nThat night my mom blew up at Ben about spending her money on some drinks without including her. I ended up arranging breakfast plans with everybody Saturday morning to calm her down, which seemed to work. \n\n  \n\n\n\\----- \n\n  \n\n\nThe rest of Saturday she was pretty friendly and nothing was really dramatic, but she definitely kept getting really close to me and trying to act super intimate and cuddly and it was a little hard for me. \n\n  \n\n\n\\---- \n\nSunday morning she woke up early, and so did I. She sent a bunch of texts asking if anyone was awake, but I decided to try to sneak out for a little time by myself and pretended not to get them. She was at the bottom of the stairs when I came down and said \"come have coffee with me\" and I said \"I was thinking I'd go for a walk by myself for a little while before synagogue\" and she was like \"no, come have coffee with me it's so nice here\" so I did. She was trying to be snuggly and make me sit next to her and I said I was more comfortable across and then she was basically like \"what's your problem, you're being so rude\" and I said something along the lines of \"you're asking me to pretend to be feeling super comfortable and intimate and close with you, and I'm not a good enough actor to do that. I want to get along and have this trip be pleasant enough that I'm not so anxious before the next one, but you're really pushing me to be more close than I'm comfortable with.\" Then she wanted to try to talk it out and said she was ready to listen and she just doesn't understand what I have such an axe to grind about. She was like \"tell me what's wrong, I'm ready to listen, I just want to be positive. Why can't you just be positive?\" And I got pretty emotional (crying, not yelling) and said I was trying to repair things slowly by talking to her about my life and she wasn't even listening because she just kept turning it around to her boyfriend. I said for now what I would hope for was for us to get along and be able to talk about the basics and I hoped we'd get to the rest of the bigger stuff from there. Then she just kept pushing that she was done with the negativity and if I didn't clear the air with her now I wouldn't have another chance in the future because she is moving on. I left to get a coffee, she sent this text: \n\n  \n\n\n\" _OK- Mir- ripping the bandaid off. I just want to be positive. If you want to tell me how you feel, I will listen. It is MY perception - that you are testing me and judging me. I'm done with that. I am just moving on from here. If there are issues from the past that you need to discuss with me, tell me; you can write them to me, or make a list for discussion. Otherwise we should create a ritual - and reset or relationship to move forward from here. I love you, I want to just have fun, let's clear the air. \"_\n\n  \n\n\nI talked to Oliver for a while and then replied with this: _\"I understand how much it hurts you that our relationship is so broken, and I'm sorry. I came this weekend because I wanted to make a positive step. I want our relationship to be better just as much as you do, but you're pushing me too hard to be on your schedule. And that means you're not respecting me, my boundaries or how I feel right now. Today it would be really great if we could just be together and I can talk to you about life as it is now and we can stay away from some of these bigger topics. We'll get there, but Rome wasn't built in a day\"_\n\n__   \n\n\nHer reply _: \"I don't feel any need to explore bigger topics. The weight lifted off of me is enormous- revisiting the past is not fun. I like the moments when we can just be light... Maybe some recreational shopping after party. Looks like you may need new Toms. or a nap..._ \" (The offer about shopping bugged me because she always gets pissed that I only want to spend time with her if she buys me things after using shopping to end arguments) but, I decided the coast was clear and came back to the hotel. \n\n\\--- \n\nThe rest of Saturday afternoon and my grandma's party went ok, mainly because I spent the whole time with Sophie and ben. When I was leaving for the airport, she got really close to me and started talking about how she and I should go on a vacation just the 2 of us, someplace really fun, and only talk about the present and the future, not the past, and it would be zen and wonderful. I said for now I really appreciated this weekend and gathering like this with everybody. Then I burst into tears, which was awkward, and had to say goodbye to everyone crying, which no one really understood, except Sophie, who is a hero. \n\n\\----- \n\nWhen I got to the airport I found out my flight was delayed such that I would miss my connection, and my best bet was to go back and stay with the family at the hotel until this morning. I was completely freaked out, and felt like I had used up every ounce of self control and was really emotional and really depleted and crying and it wasn't going so well. When they picked me back up I played it as being really tired because I hadn't gotten good sleep while I was here and we went to dinner then did some arguing about rooming arrangements so I could have a chance to get decent sleep before going back to the airport at 4am. (So much good that did, I'm wide awake at 2am) but anyway, at dinner things really went to shit. \n\n  \n\n\nAaron was getting really agitated and he said something nasty to Sophie that I think he thought would play as comedic, basically \"Ben just settled for the 3rd girl he was ever with\" and I said that was out of line and tried to say something about how I felt like Aaron had been acting really gruff (he's been really aggressive and arrogant most of the weekend) in the way that seemed inspired by certain characters on TV. Where I was going with it was that I think he feels a lot of pressure to cover for not knowing what to say with being arrogant because that's what media tells him is his only choice by glorifying that in these autistic male antihero types. He didn't like that, but before I said a whole sentence he grabbed my phone, started screaming, then threw it down on the ground. While this was happening my mom asked the waiter to take a group photo and made us all get arranged for it. As soon as the photo was taken Aaron threw a glass across the restaurant, got glass everywhere then stormed out. My mom looked straight across the table right at me and basically said \"look what you did.\" I also left, and my mom revoked her offer to drive me to the airport. \n\n  \n\n\nThen I got some fun text messages: \n\n  \n\n\nFrom Aaron: \" _It's nice how you can be so tolerant of disability whenever it's \"adorable\" but be a bigot when it comes to your own brother. I fucking try day in and day out to do the best I can and yes, sometimes I struggle with things, but for you to think that I'm just imitating tv shows or something like that is beyond offensive. It's dehumanizing and cruel._ \" \n\n  \n\n\nI said \" _I'm looking forward to talking about this with you when we're both less stressed. I think we both have a lot to learn from this and I am open to hearing more about why what I did upset you so much. No matter what I said, that level of violence was unacceptable\"_\n\n__   \n\n\n_His response: \"What you said was wrong on so many levels, I had no way to use words to respond to it. I'm in the room. You can come over here and talk. I'm calm. Angry, but calm.\"_\n\n  \n\n\nMe: \" _I'm not talking to you tonight_ \" \n\n  \n\n\nAaron: \" _I would appreciate at least saying goodbye._ \" \n\n  \n\n\nMe: \" _Not with the level of aggression you showed me. Also, You didn't actually hear what I had to say before you flipped out, so I think what's necessary is for both of us to calm down_ \" \n\n  \n\n\nAaron: \" _And you didn't show aggression towards me? I heard enough of what you had to say. I'm sorry for reacting in the violent way I did. I lost control of myself in a extremely difficult situation_ .\" \n\n  \n\n\nMe: _\"You and I have been getting along and learning from each other. I had no idea how what I said would make you feel. I'm sorry, truly. But it's a conversation I want to have with you when both of us are under less stressful circumstances \"_\n\n  \n\n\nAaron: \" _I do want to get a chance to say goodbye. It's very important to me that the violent outburst not be the last thing you see out of me for possibly months._ \" \n\n  \n\n\nI talked to Oliver again for a few minutes, then decided to go talk to Aaron. Our conversation was really great. I was able to apologize for saying what I did. He actually was really appreciative about what I had been trying to say and able to explain why he found it so hurtful in the way I said it. \n\n  \n\n\n\\--- \n\nMeanwhile, my mom sent me these: \n\n_\"Have a safe flight. If you are unable to get a cab, call me by 3:30 and I'll drive you. If you like you can discuss your sullen, nasty behavior and make excuses. You owe Aaron an apology... Aaron has been too good to deserve your nastiness. Whatever mood you are in, get a ducking grip. You are an adult._\n\n__   \n\n\n_Fucking grip. Be kind to Aaron. He isn't one of your students but you owe him so much more. Be gracious- your inability to take the position of the \"other\" is scaring me. You came with attitude- take your attitude with you- or make amends b4 you go. Like I said- choose. I am done being caught up in negative. And your spin on the events of my life is the biggest lie of all. Make it right with Aaron. You hurt him for no reason but your own unhappiness.\"_\n\n  \n\n\nI said \" _Aaron n and I are fine. We're talking now and we're ok. It's you who Indonesia with_ \"  <\\-- typo for \"its you who I am finished with\", which was probably not a helpful thing to say but I was pretty fried \n\n  \n\n\nMom: \" _What did you say?? Miriam, spread your hate. I know you could not get a better person for a mother. Time for you to be be worthy._ \" \n\n  \n\n\nMe: \" _Aaron and I are fine. We're talking and laughing. It's you and I who are finished_ \" \n\n  \n\n\nMom: \" _Good. You are too toxic for me. I hope you realize the loss as much as I do. The door will always be open but I will not subject myself to your abuse._ \" (At this point she included the photo from dinner) \" _A memento. Something is eating you. It is not me. I have given you time and space. WE don't talk to each other- not in months. Whatever the negative is, not originating with me_ .\" \n\n\\---- \n\nAaron, Ben and I had an amazing conversation. Aaron and I totally worked through what I was trying to say and came to a really good understanding. I also showed them the text messages I'd been getting from mom. They were shocked, I guess they had no idea what I meant when I would talk about not getting along with mom. They both felt really protective of me and expressed that they completely understood now what I meant when I said it was different for me, and why I haven't wanted to travel to spend time with the family. Ben got mad about how sexist it was : ) The 3 of us talked about how hard it is for us to get along when mom is around and how much we love each other and want to work on being closer. We talked about making plans for a visit together just us. \n\n\\--- \n\nThen Aaron showed me the messages my mom had been sending him while this was all going on: \n\n_I can't apologize for Miriam but she has a chip on her shoulder for two years and it's time for her to move on. If you want to come talked my room. But call first so I'm dressed. I told her to make amends. Miriam can bleed her venom about me though. I do my best. Exhausted by her attitude. I want nice. Aaron- you have been the glue in this family. I wanted to take over the job but no one trusts me quite yet. I do the best I can. I tried to make everyone happy tonight. I can't do more. I'm sad. Don't let M poison you. She has caused enough damage. Dad tactic. Beware._\n\n  \n\n\nMy mom was also messaging all of us (me, Ben, Aaron and Sophie) this: \n\n_\"I am trying too hard and sacrificing too much to take care of and placate everyone. I think it's high time we all acted kindly towards each other. I am open to suggestions about how to move on but I am not tolerating meanness and sullenness. I think we all make/made mistakes. Where we choose to go from here is what will define us. I'm going to sleep. Travel safe, Miriam. Whatever you do, don't bleed negative energy to Bubbe & Papa. They deserve only joy.\" _\n\n__   \n\n\nAt this point, I went to bed, and my mom stayed up to write me this _:_\n\n\" _I set my alarm for 4. I will be awake. You said we were finished but you are my daughter so I know we will never be finished. As always, I'll give you wide berth/time/space. You made lots of accusations about me in such a short time. I'm frightened by your ability to twist facts to suit you. It's best for you to take a cab to the airport. Those airport trips are too emotional anyway. If you would like to say goodbye, I will be awake. I don't want to \"crowd\" you so I won't leave my room. If you want to, knock on my door, I will be up._\n\n_Miriam, I hope we can get through this. I'll be around, not going anywhere. But if your behavior hurts me, I will not tolerate it. You choose how to spin what I say. I'm human though. Dad often accused me of lying too. I don't lie, PERIOD. If you pick at scabs you just make things worse. We have the present and the future. Can't change the past. I love you,_\n\n_Mom\"_\n\n__   \n\n\nSince I was up anyway, I decided the best thing to do was leave earlier and claim that I was nervous about security lines. So, I sent this after getting in a cab at 3:30: \" _I was up anyway, and nervous about missing my flight because of what they said about the security lines, so I am already on my way to the airport. Love you. Thanks for the trip._ \" \n\n  \n\n\nThis was her response: \" _Ok consider this your hug. I hope you didn't mean it when you said we were finished. I think we say lots of things we both don't mean. I think it would be good to just move on. We could do it without the bloodletting. But a ritual bloodletting could be cathartic. Seeing you this weekend made me remember how fun and funny you can be. Travel safe. Text me when u r home. (I'll worry)\"_\n",

I found it helpful but over the last few months I came to most of these realizations myself. I think this book would have helped me 5-10-15 years ago... now it's just like \"I told you so\", but no one ever told me before...   \n  \nI wish I knew then what I know now... that's all I can say. I was depressed- almost catatonic- for so long. You didn't know because I wanted things to be \"normal\" for you and because I didn't understand that things weren't OK. I made light of things like \"Pick on Mommy Day.\" I thought the balance would eventually shift. Now that the fog is lifted and I see how happy I am, I see more clearly how terrible the situation was- for you. I have to put the past behind me now. I am not going to wear my heart on my sleeve. I survived. I will always have questions about what _I_ could have done; Dad was very complex and I thought I did the best I could to help him. I just didn't know what the real issues were. There is nothing I can do for him any more. Let's just move on. I love you, I want to have meaningful relationships with only empathic people from now on. mom   \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nHi Mir,   \n\n\nIt is such a relief to be done! I planted a little shrub yesterday... just by coincidence. It has been exhausting but yesterday really felt different. All along, I just wanted to know what would happen. It didn't matter what- I just wanted to know with certainty what the outcome would be. Now I know. I'll be OK. No one is gonna starve!   \n  \n\n\nDad and I each got a little emotional at the end. That actually felt good & normal. I don't feel bitter or angry. I'm sure I will have my moments but I think you can trust me to be more in control of what I say.   \n  \n\n\nAbout the records. I think the best thing would be for you to talk directly to my lawyer, Molly. I think she can talk freely to you without fear of violating Attorney-Client privilege but I will sign any document necessary for you to have full access to information in her possession. That said, knowing Molly she will tell you that a divorce really is just about \"division of assets\" to the extent that there is \"story\" it really is about supporting a case for an equitable and fair division of assets. So then the massive files are really only a part of a story. It took me a long time to understand this. Illinois is a no-fault divorce state.   \n  \n\n\nI think you know the whole story already- really. There are no details that will change your overall perspective. It's ironic that I should say this when I felt I needed to \"know\" everything. The depositions that were taken by my attorneys were in support of my case. The depositions that Dad's attorneys took were in support of his case. I have NOT read some, was present at all except Scott's and one (the one with Citadel) is sealed and it only deals with the structure of Dad's income. All together there is not much emotionally-useful information in the depositions.   \n  \n\n\nWe are VERY lucky there was no trial; but again, the law is not interested in anything but \"Is there a reason this pie should not be split 50-50?\" And does either individual have a right to spousal support for the future. I will be supported. I bought the house so I'll stay where I am for now. Dad & I both accept what the judge recommended and attested that we think it is \"fair and just.\" I'm sure that neither of us believes it emotionally, but it's _true._ Marriage is a legal contract and divorce is too.   \n  \n\n\nI suggest that you have a sit-down talk with Molly. IN PERSON, in he office so she can dig through the boxes. There are 2 cubic yards of boxes of reports, depositions, bank records. I saw the pile of boxes on the day we were going to have a trial. They were delivered by truck, no joke.   \n  \n\n\nMolly is young (36), brilliant  & funny. She will make you feel comfortable. If it's OK with you, (tell me) I will share this note with her and you can talk to her directly. I will release her to talk to you. I will pay the legal fees for her time, so be economical.   \n  \n\n\nI have learned so much ABOUT MYSELF over the last 20 months. I made a lot of mistakes. I am stronger, wiser, faster than I ever thought I would be and I don't want to focus on the past. Our family had many happy times. Even with all the pain, the good far outweighs the bad. I am confident that all of our relationships will be stronger in the future. I will be mindful of the consequences of things I say and do my best to preserve the good in our lives. It was a tough 20 months. The future is much more important than the past.   \n  \n\n\nDad and I raised compassionate, brilliant, creative and resourceful kids. The kids are alright! I'm alright. I want dad to be happy. The uncertainty was hard. For now I feel secure.   \n  \n\n\nLet's give each other a big hug, cry and move on.   \n  \n\n\nLet me know if you want me to discuss this with Molly. She will tell me what steps I need to take to get you the information you want. I do think that with respect, you may want to ask dad too.   \n  \n\n\nI love you. You have been wise and thoughtful, I'm sorry I didn't realize how wise until too late. I am so proud of you and the way you chose to handle our relationship. These are not just words. I have learned from you.   \n  \n\n\nBe happy! I love you!   \n\n\nmom   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nDear kids,   \n  \nWe are gonna need to move on...   \n  \n\n\nI think I have a lot to give and nothing would make me happier than just being a mom again. We have all disappointed each other. We can get together and vent about all of it- let the anger out and then move on...or we can each decide what would be best. I like rituals and meditations- even prayers...The anger has to leave somehow. I was planning a big Havdallah party for the end of the divorce but since it's taking so long I have to separate- now and be divorced. I'm leaving for Israel next week. When I come back I will start my \"post Divorce life.\" (I will have a roof over my head $300K in debt and no money!)   \n  \nI have some anger and trust issues toward the world...and toward each of you- you do with me. I have absorbed as much anger as I am able from you.   \n  \nI'm the only mom you have. You are my only kids. My parents, and the three of you are the most important people in my life now. I have amazing friends but they all have their own families.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nMaybe one day I will stumble upon someone I can love who will honor and respect me. Whoever it is, he will love you too.   \n\n\n  * Practicality, logistics and my fear of making hasty decisions will keep me at 766 Greenleaf Avenue for at least two years post divorce. I have been looking at all sorts of alternatives but everyone says I shouldn't make too many changes at once.   \n\n  * I know you are all mixed up about the house and your childhoods... what can I say?   \n\n  * THIS IS WHERE I LIVE. I am surrounded by a community _I built._ There are comfortable beds, good hot showers- it's a great summer-house. I will pay a little extra in taxes to stay in Glencoe, next door to Dawn. As always, I will use the house as a hub and make it welcoming to friends  & family. You can come, bring friends there are no nicer B&B's in the price-range.   \n\n  * I rearranged the \"deck chairs\" so it doesn't look the same. \n\nI hope you have enough happy memories in the house to make it a happy home for you. If not, we'll make some. As far as I am concerned **I made this house a home** and in spite of everything I KNOW I can still make it _a retreat for all/each of you.  \n_   \n\n\nI would very much like to spend some time with each AND all of you this summer. If we are not ready to be at home together, perhaps the three of you can plan a \"fantasy\" trip for the four of us- (that will have to wait until post-decree so I can afford it.) I would also like to have some alone time with each of you. I want to have some fun.   \n  \n\n\nSo far nothing in the divorce is making me \"whole.\" There is no amount of money that can compensate me for my loss of dignity. I have had to fight hard just to keep the \"roof.\" \n\n  \n\n\nThe way I have conducted myself over the last 18 months, while not perfect, is some measure of who I am. You may think _all I could talk about was divorce... you're right, that was all I did for the last 18 months!_ It was consuming and exhausting- it still is. _When it's over, it will be over._ The stress I feel is about _fear of the unknown._ As the fog lifts and some of the unknowns are resolved- I can see that I have the opportunity to make an AWESOME life for MYSELF... _Myself_ will never be healed unless I can make some meaning out of what happened and be stronger, wiser, faster because of the shitty experience. \n\n  \n\n\nI recently got this apology from Dad:  I thought long and hard about sharing it with you. \n\n  \n\n\n_I only responded \"thank you\"_   \nMy true response (which I shared with myself and my therapist ONLY) would have been something like this:   \n\n\n  \n**I didn't send that to Dad...**\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n**Kids:**\n\n  \n\n\nI think that when Dad wrote to me he meant it but since then he has become extraordinarily hostile and mean again. \n\n**  \n**\n\n**Right now, I have very little hope that our divorce will end any time soon. So either we continue with not communicating, or our dysfunctional family life or _we choose a better way._ I have tried to do every thing in my power to bring the divorce to a fast conclusion- hint- that should tell you how powerful I have always been... You can blame me all you want- and I know you do- but Dad is in control of practical matters, _it's the Daddy Day every day..._ The good news is that I had some control- over relationships and the things that REALLY matter. **\n\n  \n\n\nI'm not/can't be the \"pick-on Mommy\" you grew up with... I can be a resource for you but only on terms where I am not reminded of how much I allowed myself to be abused in the past. I will be hypersensitive- I'm working on that.   \n  \nI have given you a lot- especially time and space- and I am the best mom you have. You will need to be kind. I will not tolerate unkindness. That's my line in the sand.   \n  \n\n\nMiriam, you were here in the beginning. It was an awesome gift that you cared enough to be here for me. I am terrified of what the days after dad left feel like...I can't imagine what it would feel like to me if Bubbe fell apart before my eyes. It would help me a lot to look forward to a different kind of visit from you- Even for a few days.   \n  \nWe ALL need reassurance that we can be a \"normal\" family; it will take a while but if we don't start with kindness and some truth, it won't happen. It may not seem like it when you are in your 20's, but life is short. Papa just turned 80... I'm 56... who knows how many good years we have left? Nobody is getting younger and _time heals but it also erodes._ The losses and disappointments of the last 18 months and earlier won't go away. They will need to be replaced by better things.   \n  \n\n\nLove to all,   \n\n\nmom   \n  \n\n\nPS: Kindness! and honesty... All I ask. I want to hear from each of you. If you ignore this most sincere of attempts to reach out I will know that I need to move ahead without you at least until you have time off at Christmas- then I'll try again. PERIOD. I want you each to live regret-free so think about how you each want to proceed and I will respect your choices. A non-response from any of you will make me sad but I will accept that I need to back away even more. I really do love you and wish I could make things _all better._   \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nHey Miriam, Hey Aaron, Hey Ben...   \n  \nWhere are you going for Pesach?   \n  \n\n\nI decided that I would stay here for Passover and not go out to Bubbe and Papa's. The Judge was right to give us time to settle without a trial but the settlement has to get done in only 5 more business/working days and I would be too much of a stress-bunny to travel- not to mention that my lawyer would have an aneurism. I just got home from her and she wants me back on Friday morning. I told her I wasn't coming downtown in traffic this Friday because I didn't want to kill my Pesach buzz... so she is coming here for the first time (not billing for driving time!).   \n  \nLuckily I have lots of friends-with-Seders.  I'm going to the Canchesters 1st and Dawn & Michael's brother's 2nd. I got loads of other invitations and just decided to go with the first ones which came on my way home from Court on Thursday- before I even decided I wasn't going to Palm Springs. It is so weird having nothing to do all week. I really liked all the preparations and having the Seders here. (I baked a little yesterday and sent you each a small package.) I will miss _our_ Seder but I am very excited to go celebrate in other homes. I have always wanted to start a Maimouna tradition; this probably isn't the year... but definitely next year! Still, I will miss you and I am so grateful that you were here last year when I really needed you to be.   \n  \n\n\nI really want to hear about your plans and the interesting Seders you are going to.   \n\n\n  \nDara Canchester is going to lead the Seder- she sent this survey and I thought I would send it along to you.   \nI thought this was, aside from being informative (my score is mortifying) a very well done work of info-design. Let me know what you think.   \n  \n\n\n[ click here to take a survey ](http://slaveryfootprint.org/)   \nwhich shows how much modern slavery is a part of our daily lives.   \n  \n\n\nI'll call you all on Thursday / Friday  for sure. Of course, if any of you has ANY time call me any time!!   \n  \n\n\nI REALLY miss you and the excitement I always feel about \"making\" Pesach. That said, it will be so nice to just show-up!   \n  \n\n\nLove, love, love,   \n\n\nmommy   \n  \n\n\nPS: Tammie sent me a text \"Have you crossed the Red Sea yet?\" writing back \"just packing, can't decide which sandals to wear.\"   \n\n\nBTW: I have the most awesome friends. Last week sucked and they were amazing. It was a tag-team of great friends from all over- all week long. I am lucky no matter what.   \n\n",

I think that Ben will want you there when the recital AND graduation days arrive, even though he isn't making a fuss. Ben says he wants us at recital more than graduation but I think, considering how Ben is the baby and this is close to the end of the graduation \"experience\" he probably wants to savor every minute with his siblings- he was at your graduations and excuse me for overstepping, but in my opinion, you should be at his... if at all possible. Also, the Michigan graduation, while not intimate, will be an absolute spectacle and very exciting! The Music school component will be more intimate and probably very moving. M- I don't know if you've seen Ben at Michigan- and Ann Arbor is awesome & fun just for fun. We are staying at a nice hotel for graduation.   \n  \n\n\nI have rooms for you for graduation that are in very high demand, so I need to know soon about graduation- I hope that there are rooms around for recital weekend.

(I hope we actually can negotiate through this in 10 days.)   \n  \n\n\nMy lawyers are being very careful about protecting my interests (which include making sure none of you ever have to worry about me). As it turns out, I would have no idea how that's done because there are too many legal nuances. So as usual, the big trick is to pick the right professionals and then get out of their way!   \n  \n\n\nI want to know what all of you are doing for Pesach. I got so many invitations it's ridiculous! I decided to go to the Canchesters with Susie for the first Seder and to the Johnsons (Michael's brother and sister-in-law) for the second Seder.   \n  \n\n\nI REALLY want to have at least one Seder next year, but I gotta say, it feels good not having to think about cooking and cleaning this year. You were ALL angels to come home last year when I really needed you to be here. This year I hope we can all have fun where we are!   \n  \n\n\nIt is getting to be pretty soon so please think about coming to Israel- dates you can come- (Mir, you are welcome but it sounds like the trip has too many conflicts) Aaron & Ben, let's talk...   \n  \n\n\n**Can we all go to Palm Springs for May 16th. Papa will be reading the Haftarah on May 16th and Bubbe is making a party on May 17th (also my birthday but this year is all about Papa.)

   "Message preview": "\n\nHello babies,   \n\n\n  \nI had such high hopes that by now we would have gotten some resolution on Zisook v Zisook.   \nSo... We waited 15 months, what's another few weeks? We roamed the desert for 40 years- before sliced bread! I got through three pregnancies.   \n  \nThe good news is: from _my vantage point_ , _right now,_ and seeing what our Judge's (Fe Hernandez) style is, I am optimistic that she will be fair. Dad's lawyers excused the first Judge. We could have excused one Judge also, but we didn't. I don't think my lawyer has ever argued a bench trial with Hon. Fernandez so it was a little scary for me. Apparently some judges like trials and others don't. We could have gotten a judge who would have gone straight to trial after a short pre-trial conference- so our witnesses were there. Apparently Judge Hernandez prefers to sit in her comfortable chambers without the black robe, and talk to lawyers directly until she understands the case. If she gets stumped and can't tell what's going on she convenes a trial. I didn't realize it until after, but this seems like a really lucky break because I was _really_ nervous about sitting in a witness box with a court reporter and lawyers shouting objections. So instead of jumping into high courtroom drama, both sets of lawyers spent nearly two WHOLE days, basically describing our case more privately with the judge. I sat in the courtroom with Sharon and I never saw Dad. I think he was at work. At the end of two days the judge thought that one day would not be enough time for the two sides could negotiate the whole thing, so she cancelled today's trial date so that we could all have more time to craft a balanced agreement.   \n  \nI think it's actually a gift, even though when my lawyer told me I said I could not survive another two weeks of anxiety. As usual, I didn't really have any say in the matter. So, we go back to Judge Hernandez on 4/9. She has asked/court ordered the lawyers to come to an agreement and present it to her then. Then she can rule on an agreement instead of a \"trial.\" The lawyers know that they won't have much time with her so they want to get close to what the judge will say is fair... I don't think either side wants to appear greedy or intransigent. It's a dance... I feel encouraged by some of the progress so far.   \n  \n\n\nI'm not sure I could have actually handled another day of \"court.\" I think two weeks is just the right amount of time for both \"parties\" to think about how to make sure we each get as close to what we want as possible. Mostly the lawyers and accountants will scream at each other until they agree to each cave in not quite where they hoped they would be.   \n  \n\n\nI am finally understanding why the symbol for justice is a balanced scale. That's the ideal...   \n  \n\n\nThe best part of today was having a \"found\" day to just relax. Call me if you want me to tell you more but I really don't know much more. I would love to hear your voices...   \n  \n\n\nShabbat Shalom!   \n  \n\n\nmommy   \n\n\n  \n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nOK- sorry, I must have missed the call... \n\nIt was a very crazy week last week. This one is barely better. I have a 3 hour lawyer/accountant meeting today. \n\n  \n\n\nAbout your Jury summonses: I am in that building pretty often, I will stop by and check the next time I'm there. The lady at the desk is very nice. I think she is the person who will answer if you call. It's funny to meet the actual people in something as vast as the Justice system of Illinois. I have new respect for all of it. The Judges, the marshalls, court reporters, even the custodians are all real people. They do their jobs. \n\n  \n\n\n**I am so ready to be DONE!!! Read this all later with a cup of tea- including the attachments... nothing upsetting- except it all is.**   \n\n\nI have been collapsing in the evenings but I'll call you tonight (unless today is too much.) I will be happy when today is over, there will only be a few more days like today where I have depositions or aggravating meetings. \n\n  \n\n\nToday I have to \"substantiate\" my \"lifestyle.\" Yippee. (I know, WTF??) The aggravation and paperwork is really starting to wear thin- but I have been surviving one hurdle at a time. I am turning into a great secretary for my lawyers. You would _not_ believe how much more organized I am! I had to go through years of bills to figure out what my budget really was. \n\n  \n\n\nAnyway, I am particularly put out to have to go to a meeting TODAY. The ONLY available time was _during_ the first of my 10 weekly painting classes that I just signed up for. Next Tuesday will be better. \n\n  \n\n\nIn preparation for my meeting today I woke up and wrote down some of my thoughts about my lifestyle- I am sharing them with you- I hope not oversharing. (the spreadsheet is the actual assignment, but I needed to get my head around the whole \"lifestyle\" thing because the essence of divorce law is that I am \"entitled\" legally to maintain the lifestyle to which I have become accustomed. I have a problem with the whole \"entitled\" thing. I also have a hard time feeling like I deserve much. OY! Where do I begin?? I just started the spreadsheet part. Mostly I have to talk about the things that don't show up on MY credit card statements. I am _really_ trying to make the case that my lifestyle _includes my kids_ \\- don't know if I have a legal leg to stand on but that's the most important thing. \n\n  \n\n\nThere is nothing negative or upsetting- really, you'll recognize most of it. I'll attach it here. I feel good writing down some of my values, the writing may be _g-d-awful-terrible_ but it's honest. I need to get my head around what's important before I get stuck in the weeds with the accountant today. I will give him a copy once I edit it - but we will also work on it together- that's why he makes the big-bucks! \n\n(I am too self conscious about my writing, not my thoughts- I want you to know what I think but when I edit it all just gets worse and more-not less-stilted.) \n\n  \n\n\nLove you. Hang in here with me, just 2.5 more months. Look how far we've come! I don't like to ask, but I _do want to know how_ all of this is affecting you. I will listen if you want to tell me. \n\n  \n\n\nMommy \n\n  \n\n\nPS: The lifestyle \"expert\" was dad's lawyer's great idea. He totally low-balled me by not including anything that dad routinely paid for... I don't think that was necessarily Dad's fault. The lawyers (both sides) fight hard for their clients. Mine are fighting hard for me. I hope mine may are more scrupulous- who knows! \n\n  \n\n\nThis too shall pass... \n\n  \n\n\nLove, mommy \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n",

Usually winter doesn't start to get to me until January but this year the cold and grey were already a little overwhelming- so I'm off. \n\n  \n\n\nI am really soooooo happy the three of you will be together for Thanksgiving. It's warming my heart thinking about the 3 of you together- and not in a sad way. We will all be just where we need to be this week. \n\n  \n\n\nI will get to Palm Springs at around noon PST today. On Wednesday we'll drive up the coast to Gil & Helen's for Thanksgiving and then drive back on Saturday for more fun in the sun! I will be home on Wednesday December 3rd. You can call me any time but I totally get it if we all re-group later... I hope I will get to see your three faces together at home for a few days over winter break, but I'll take what I can get. \n\n  \n\n\nIt's been a tough year- Bubbe & Papa have been amazing through all of it- **to all of us.** I hope you never need me like I need them,- but you know I'm here and I have excellent role models! \n\n  \n\n\nI may, or may not go to Palm Springs for Christmas now- it depends on my pre-trial jitters- _but if you can get out to Palm Springs to visit GREAT._ (One small detail, B  & P are probably going for Liron'e baby's Bris which could be a few weeks from now- right smack in the middle of X-mas break. so maybe hold off on airline tickets.) \n\n  \n\n\n**Please send pictures of the three of you together** and of Thanksgiving at Helene  & Jims.

Don't use credit Cards except for the United Mileage + one which Aaron has-  & use that sparingly. The Amex's 's you have will most likely be declined. I can't use the pre-distribution to pay the credit cards down- my lawyers say... BTW- this is totally ADD-random but Dire Straights is an awesome Band that I loved in the 70's & 80's you should listen! Ben, have you heard of them? (of course you have.)

I'm still sending Yoga/year just haven't done it yet- waiting for the last minute but definitely in time for a seamless transition (next few days...) \n\n  \n\n\nSo funny- I am having lunch with Emily Macdonald on Friday and I asked her if she would help me pick out a bike... I would like to start riding again. I was a BIG biker in HS & College... I did have a bad accident that put me off for a while. Boston is not my favorite place to be thinking about you riding but stay on trails as much as you can and BE SAFE! Frankly, I can't imagine riding in Boston, but I bet it's more bike friendly now- between the hills and the crazy drivers- I rode very little. I had a bike; It was locked up at Harvard- Gil & I both used it until it was stolen. I saved up babysitting $$ to buy that bike in HS. I had it at U of C too. Once or twice I put you in an infant seat on the back of my bike (different bike) but was terrified and never did it again. There's a picture - just one. \n\n  \n\n\nKOREA??? Wow. I hope you get in. If you do, is it in April again? April seems like a long way off, but it may be a whole life-time for me. \n\n  \n\n\nNot much new here. I really loved being with Ben for the race. Sophie and I bonded all day. Ben was amazing. Who knew that little baby had it in him to set impossible goals and reach them. I was inspired- just not quite enough to get off my tush... \n\n  \n\n\nThe hard weeks are continuing... but I want to be proud of how I handle myself under stress so I am making it so... as much as I can. BIG day tomorrow then I need a BIG rest. I am finally realizing that it's better to take one thing/day at a time and treat myself to rest after the big stress days. \n\n  \n\n\nI hope school is great this year- catch me up on summer next time you write. \n\n  \n\n\nDon't get \"Macher-itis\" with Kavod- your \"Chai-ness\"!

I haven't done any painting/drwaing/arts/crafts lately. \n\n  \n\n\nWrite again soon with more details. \n\nLove you, \n\nmom \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nHi baby-girl, Here's the digest for now- nothing here that will be news... but I wanted to get more current so you know why I have been so upset lately. no spoilers here- this is pretty safe to read. It's about the process, no details to upset you- I hope! \n\n  \n\n\nI have deposition transcripts from Mr. Mason. I don't think there is anything in there that you will find surprising- reading it in black and white was chilling and there were a few new details that really don't change much but were just hard & upsetting to read. If you want to see the transcript ask me- but I see no need for now- except curiosity- honestly, better to ask questions than read it- you can't un-read it! \n\n  \n\n\nMy deposition transcript will be available soon. There were some personal questions that were just icky and I wouldn't want you to have to see them. If you want to read through it I will send it. Just ask. It should take a week or two for me to even see it. \n\n  \n\n\nDivinae will be deposed next week. I am sure that will be interesting and may make me cringe- My lawyers want me there for most, but not all of the questions. They will tell me when I can leave the room. I know I will read the transcript when it is available- and then wish I hadn't. \n\n  \n\n\nDad won't be deposed for a little longer. Scott may be deposed soon. There will be quite a few other parties deposed... None of it is pretty. So far there are no depositions scheduled other than mine on my \"side.\" I don't think there would be much point. \n\n  \n\n\nThe main purpose of the depositions is to establish a timeline/scale for how much money was dissipated. Bad/or good behavior is not a factor in Illinois Divorces. The amount dissipated is relevant because it may amount to _A LOT_ of money which I would prefer to give to charity or use for good things. It will have to be paid back from Dad's side of the ledger- in the settlement or by the judge's order. The ball-park is $1-2M. I would get half of that. \n\n  \n\n\nAnother purpose of the depositions is to establish a pattern or lifestyle that is considered normal for me and \"maintain\" it. Most judges don't really use evidence for this but rather award a proportional/percentage of the \"earnings\" (dad's- and mine if I go back to work) usually by a formula based on the length of the marriage. Our matrimonial court Judge (who is not our trial judge) has said the following to Dad's lawyers...\"to me this looks like 50-50% for life...\" She has been impatient with Dad's level of cooperation. She was frustrated when she said them, but those were very encouraging words. I doubt if I'll get there but that would be sort of a best-case. \n\n  \n\n\nPersonally, **I really want _LESS not MORE_ information ** about dad's bad choices- I will assume the same about you and the boys. Technically, I don't have to read the depositions- but my lawyers ask me to because I am the one that can find the misinformation. Also, I guess on some level I just really do want to know what happened- and then move on. \n\n  \n\n\nThe other \"facts\" on the ground are just not so important- but very hurtful and aggravating to me. They have to do with the way the lawyers (both sets) are picking  & fighting their battles... I don't like to hear what dad is telling his lawyers about me and/or vice versa. Some of the deposition questions to me are laughable but they still bite and show a real misogynistic bias. Maybe some time when this is well over we can laugh about some of the things the lawyers have tried to stick on me... for now it's hard to find any of it funny. There is some desperation to build a case to counter my case and I am very sensitive about the kinds of things that anyone- even people that know me- will believe, coming from dad's lawyers... I am getting a much thicker skin which, like I said, will make everything better. \n\n  \n\n\nI really hate the whole situation and will be so relieved when it's over- and fair-ish (it will never be fair.) \n\n  \n\n\nI will keep copies of the depositions for the future but will ask the court to seal the case because I don't want any of this hanging around in the public domain for too long. \n\n  \n\n\nIf there is a trial, I will be entitled to a transcript, I believe- I will keep a copy. \n\n  \n\n\nI would like the trial, if there is one, to be as private as possible- I don't think any of you 3 will want to be there. There is no need for you to be there _at all._ I hope this settles without a trial but I will be prepared for one. Technically, I will be the one on trial because dad filed for divorce first but in reality that just means the case opens and closes with his lawyers. My lawyers are doing their job which is to make sure I am secure and get a settlement that is the best possible under the law. I probably won't understand all the nuances and safeguards they will put into the mix. Dad's lawyers will fight HARD to allow Dad to have as much as is legally possible. \n\n  \n\n\nIt's harder now for me to encourage you to do anything but keep a safe distance from dad but you know, there are two sides to this story. I am hurt by what I am hearing about Dad's story- but what can I say... I think he was a lucky guy that- sadly- didn't know it. \n\n  \n\n\nI really don't want to editorialize. I think you do - and will continue to- have independent judgments about how this all effects you... I just wanted you to know that there will be some \"original source material\" that I will only share by special request... \n\n  \n\n\nlove ya, \n\n  \n\n\nShabbat Shalom! \n\n  \n\n\nPS: I hope this is OK info- really I said from the beginning I would share stuff that would be in the public domain now or in the future. Luckily we are still in the early part of the 21st century. The depositions and court briefs are still on microfilm and you have to go to the courthouse to get them... Don't bother with that. If you are curious, I will keep a file somewhere in the house and you can look at it when you want... so no sharing for now, except that it is all very hard to absorb!!! \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n",

But once the trial is over (January 9th- or some number of days later, I will have the records sealed permanently- assuming dad agrees, which is likely.) \n\n  \n\n\nMiriam, the reason I sent you the email I did the other day is to (perhaps a little harshly) warn you that there isn't a lot of \"nice\" happy news. I am struggling with some realizations about how much I was _gaslighted_ . I am very scared that I was not the mom I should have been for a very long time. I definitely isolated myself and was depressed. That much you probably know. _There are patterns that developed over the last 10 years that we have to break._ I don't know how. All I want to do is laugh with you again. \n\n  \n\n\nI am so sorry for not being more aware. I understand how you SHOULD all be angry at me. If I were you, I would be angry at me. I should have known. I don't know how I didn't. I should have run away but I knew you needed me. I think my instincts told me that I would never keep you if I left. That life with me would just be one long \"mommy Day\" disaster. I hope that I was enough of a mom to keep you as whole as possible- how could I have been??? I want to make this up to you-somehow. I will be careful. \n\n  \n\n\nFor now- let's each think of ways to get past this somehow... please send your thoughts. \n\n  \n\n\nIt's OK for you to ask me- SCREAM!!! \"HOW DID YOU NOT KNOW???\" I am trying to figure that out. \n\n  \n\n\nI just imagined that you were all happy, you seemed happy. We had great trips and lots of good years- I hope. I always just thought that the Mommy Days and Daddy Days were how you all experienced things. I thought dad was great to you and provided well emotionally- and at least in terms of your financial needs and security he seemed to really care. I always felt a little left out anyway-you seemed to have so much fun together on your separate adventures. I was not really included in most of those- and definitely not in the planning. I thought that was a good thing. Things were just better when Dad planned things... that was my experience. Things seemed good except for me I thought. It is a revelation that you had anything but true affection for dad and that you saw some of the signs that I did. Maybe the lesson is we should be sharing now. \n\n  \n\n\nI am so sorry! I don't know what to say or how to say it. \n\n  \n\n\nI love you so much. \n\n  \n\n\nMommy - as in \"Mommy Day\"-( you know the kind of day that goes so wrong that you learn how to be independent and not rely on Mommy!) \n\n  \n\n\nMom \n\n  \n\n\nPlease let me know what you think. I realize you will all want to know different things... I'll try to keep track. \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "Yup. But beyond that, I feel a little bit beaten up. I have an insight. I realize that every divorce story has 2 parties and I am not \"blameless.\" Without exposing you to more than you want to know, it's hard for me to tell you how damaging our marriage was- And how much I worry about the effects on you. \n\n  \n\n\nPlease read as much as you can about sex addiction, narcissism and Sociopathy. It will help you understand why I cannot have more people trying to control my interactions with them right now. I want desperately to know how my \"not knowing\"what was happening made you vulnerable. I want to help you heal. \n\n  \n\n\nAlso, as much as you don't want to hear it. I don't think covering your ears and singing lalala- is really your best advised choice. Talk to your therapist- Take this email. Read about and _get to know a \"generic\" sex addict-narcissist-sociopath._ Have a good talk with Kay Russell. Decide if what happened to me was my fault- or if I was just \"too good for my own good.\" Ask yourself why Dad chose Scott. And then decide if you want to add insult to injury. I hope I was a good enough mom to make you whole. I think I was as good as I could be. For me, the proof is that I did not raise monsters- I raised beautiful loving children who are magnificent adults- \n\n  \n\n\nYes- I wish I knew- and stood up to your father the way I can now assert myself. It's been a steep learning curve but I have changed - I'm still loyal and, I hope- good. \n\n  \n\n\nMy insight is that __This is how narcissists are made._ _ They experience this kind of betrayal as children when they are way too vulnerable. Dad is very damaged. I knew that, he had a very thick (and prickly) protective shell. I had no frame of reference for his kind of damage. I was out of my league in trying to \"keep him together.\" I have the emotional ballast to survive this betrayal. I hope we all do. I don't know how I failed to protect you from Dad. Whatever the effects, you are my daughter too - and bubbe's grand-daughter. (Imagine all that she survived and turned to the light.) You grew up surrounded by love, stability, and loyal Friendship. I think the lesson that I tried to teach you most was how to choose your \"people.\" The irony of that is astonishing! You will get through. \n\n  \n\n\nBut really, this is so dark, you need to really engage to understand- I get why you don't want to - but you had a very sick father and you need to be sure there won't be lasting issues. I did my best, but like I said, I could not protect you from something so insidious and evil that I could never even imagine it (I was not raised by wolves, all I ever knew was that marriages are sometimes rocky but mutual respect and real love makes it all work.) \n\n  \n\n\nThis interaction is drawing me out as well- so I thank you. But sorry if this is more than you can \"absorb.\" \n\n  \n\n\nI love you more than anything. I want to do what is best for you and put you first. I will try to still use my instincts (you have great reason to question my instincts- I get it) I should have protected you. I should have protected myself. \n\n  \n\n\nI think Kay Russell can help you understand more... Really, she loves you. \n\n  \n\n\nShare what you are doing to cope with me, I need to stay connected to you. \n\nLove, \n\nMom \n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nPS: \n\nIf you want to begin to imagine how I feel-and why I worry about you- think about what was going on in dad's twisted world when he made me that outrageous 50th birthday party and drew you, and every one of my friends into his deception... \n\n  \n\n\nHow complicated is this??? On recent visits home you began to see how I was being hurt- I know you wanted to help me- none of us knew what was happening. I want to help you now- but I have to figure it all out myself. \n\n  \n\n\nThis is way more than you want to hear - sorry.

   "Message preview": "\n\nDear Miriam, Breathe. I love you. \n\n  \n\n\nI started to respond before things went haywire... the last few weeks have been a marathon in divorce land. \n\n  \n\n\nI feel like the tone of your last email (today) is tense. The other day, I was just calling to tell you I was OK and to let you know I was thinking about you even though I had not responded to your _last_ email... Honestly, I was hoping to hit the re-set button and not tell you that I felt hurt. So I kept just not sending what I really did put some thought and care into writing. So here is what I wrote and didn't send you. I did not want to send an anger sounding letter. The following will probably sound a little like scolding to you. I'm sorry, it's still how I feel, pretty much. \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n_ From draft as it was two weeks ago...  _\n\n\" I woke up thinking about your email so I decided to read it again. \n\nI found the overall tone to be dour, scolding and lacking in a sense of humor. I desperately want you to lighten up. I have had enough humorless scolding to last me a lifetime or two. \n\n  \n\n\nYou could have thanked me for opening up and sharing some of my thoughts with you. You could have said that you appreciated that I wanted to deflect and not share. You could have responded to MY _actual_ questions. I even went to great lengths to explain my goals. And how confusing it is to be transitioning from parent of a child to parent of a self sufficient adult. \n\n  \n\n\n**What are your goals in your relationship with me?**\n\n**  \n**\n\n**How do you see the big picture of your role?**\n\n  \n\n\n_Relationships are a process-_ Harping on the problems is not really getting us anywhere. I just feel like you are trying to assert some sort of power over me. \n\n  \n\n\nThe moments are what's important in our relationship and we will squander all of the moments in a discussion like this.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nI was open with you, I told you I would work on my issues, that it would take time and asked you to be patient. You came back with impatience. \n\n  \n\n\nWith due respect, I am working on lots of things and had already added my relationship with you to the list many months ago. I am trying to stay as focused as I can but that is the challenge in \"situational\" or any other kind of depression. \n\n  \n\n\nI am not being defensive. re-read what you wrote, notice its tone. How would you feel if I wrote that way to you? \n\n  \n\n\nYes, I don't proof. I want my voice to come through loud and clear. I think I have a nice voice. \n\n  \n\n\nPlease be VERY specific and ask me for SPECIFIC things. I already have FOCUS on my list. \n\n  \n\n\n**What's my next challenge?**\n\n**  \n**\n\n**I want to make this work. But like I said, I will be myself.** _Myself_ is spontaneous, kind, loving, forgiving, I am not mean (wish I could be sometimes.) I have recently discovered strength and resilience that I didn't know I had. I also now know that my instincts are valid. I need to rely more, not less, on them. My instinct tells me that for whatever reason, you want to either punish, or control me. If I am wrong, please explain. \n\n  \n\n\n_ ******************************************  _   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI didn't send it because I was feeling angry about the tone of what you wrote and not focusing on the words- so I wanted to revisit it a few times in different moods and see how I would read it differently at different times. I have actually re-read what you wrote many times and every time I have felt scolded. I know you want there to be \"ease\" in our relationship that is missing- I do too. I hope that it is not your intention, to scold me, maybe it's your writing style- I don't know. I can only tell you how reading your email makes _me_ feel. \n\n  \n\n\nI just re-read it again and there is a theme I didn't pick up on before. The idea that I treat you as a symbol or abstraction instead of a real daughter. How could you possibly think you are anything but the most real thing in the world to me. I was in labor with you for 3 weeks! I raised you; watched Gilmore Girls and the Doggie Movie with you, helped you nest into a few apartments, and went to NY, and the Rock  & Roll Hall of fame with you. I learned everything I know about being a mom from you (3). And I will continue to be fascinated by you and learn from you until I die. You are not just a cute little voice (you do have a very sweet adorable voice though). \n\n  \n\n\nI called you on Friday because I was so excited to tell you that I was going to see Mimi (Miriam) who was born 3 weeks before you and _her_ mommy- one of my oldest closest friends (we met when we were 15...) I couldn't put in an email the joy I was feeling and the first person I wanted to tell was you- obviously. I wish you the depth of friendship with your friends when you are my age that I have with mine. \n\n  \n\n\nYou are not a symbol. You are a real-live funny, smart beautiful woman who is interesting and fun to talk to. I love the real moments with you when we are just ourselves and know each other so well that it just works- I really like our \"cheapen shvetters\" moments and I want to have the time and space to relax and have fun with you.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nBut now that I see that you misunderstand, I really don't know what to say... Your email today just makes me feel like I can't seem to get it right no matter how much I want to- or try to strike the right notes. \n\n  \n\n\nI think we each have a rough edge that is snagging each other. We'll get there. I personally think talking - or going to a spa- is easier than writing but I'll keep trying to get it right either way. \n\n  \n\n\nI love you, \n\n  \n\n\nMom \n\n  \n\n\nPS: Tammie just left a little while ago. The first thing I did was read your email and respond. Tammie and I had a blast. It really is something to be back together for a long time after such a long time. (Over the last 30 years we haven't been in the same place together for more than a few hours at a time, so 24-7 for a few days was pretty special. Tammie is one of the few people that knows what my mom looked like at my age. She is my only grown-up friend that slept over in \"my room.\" Yup, the house is sold, Bubbe and Papa are in Palm Springs, but \"my room\" is still at 175-29 Henley Road, Jamaica NY! ... Weird and great. I really liked getting to know Mimi better. She is poised and accomplished and fun. She was totally one of the girls and we could talk about anything with her- in front of her??? - but she is still Tammie's adorable little baby. \n\n  \n\n\nSo now I'll just send this with the hope that you will read it with an open heart. \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n",

That is a big part of what makes it hard to talk to you, I hope maybe you will be able to act on noticing this pattern in some way. Possible your therapist or an ADD coach could help. I think that as much as you don’t like rereading your communication to me, it’s a really helpful thing to do. If your email jumps around and is so stream of consciousness that you’re embarrassed to read it to yourself, there’s a good chance it will make me anxious and be hard for me to read as well. \n\n  \n\n\nIn response to you asking if I want you to ask for support: I don’t. You repeat often that you would want to tell me more if only I wanted to hear it. I feel guilty when you say that because I know it’s what you want me to want. I’m really sorry, but for now I really don’t want to know more about the divorce. However, that doesn’t mean you can only talk to me when you are happy and pretend it’s not happening. You could say. “I’m really sad, this feels really hard. I want to hear your voice, and talk.” Without knowing the details, I can tell you I love you, I can tell you I’m on your side, we can talk about you and how you feel, but it’s been really good for me to hear less about what's happening with dad. If it’s important to you to tell me, I appreciate when you can update me at times you’re not very emotionally wrapped up in what you’re updating me, or when you update me via email. \n\n  \n\n\nIn response to you asking if I understand that conversations with me are “blah blah, my adult daughter:” I do understand that, but reading that makes me feel bad. To me what that says is that you’re so wrapped up in my being symbolic, that you forgot I’m a real person on the phone, who may have my own feelings or reason for calling. It is helpful to know that happens for you when I call, I will try to keep in mind that you need an extra minute at the beginning of our phone calls to land from that initial feeling. \n\n  \n\n\nBeyond just your ability to focus, there were still aspects of your response that made me feel like you’re not really hearing me. One is that you continued to say a lot about what you should or shouldn’t tell me about the divorce, and said that the only thing different in our relationship is the divorce, even though I’ve said a LOT of times that that’s not the point of what I’m saying. While the divorce may have brought a lot of this out and made it worse, the stress and anxiety I feel communicating with you that led me to only email you is a real thing. I really need you to recognize that that’s happening, and it isn’t just a problem of the content of what you tell me, but a real problem in the way you talk to (and don’t do as much listening to) me. I felt hurt hen you wrote that this was a good exercise for you. I’m not giving you an exercise, I’m trying to express my feelings and needs to you. This kind of goes with what I said above about the “blah, blah” stuff. \n\n  \n\n\nI love you, I’m glad you’re willing to talk to me about this stuff even though I know it’s hard to be criticized. I think our relationship will be a lot better because we understand each other better. \n\n  \n\n\nMiriam \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nOn Aug 1, 2014, at 7:27 PM, Nitza Zisook < [ nzisook@gmail.com ](mailto:nzisook@gmail.com) > wrote: \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nHi Mom, \n\n  \n\n\nI will try to be more specific, let’s try to stay focused on the immediate issue in this conversation and not try to zoom out to the whole divorce or the whole history of our relationship. For me, the issue right now is that I do not feel heard or listened to when we communicate. When I respond to an email from you, here’s what I do: I read it once, then I go back and respond to each thing in turn, so usually if you wrote about 5 things in your email I respond to 5 things, sometimes I don’t have something to say about one or two, but if you ask me a question I try to answer it. \n\n  \n\n\nWhen you responded to my email I felt like you hadn’t really taken it in, or gone through it and considered each piece of what I said, you just responded sort of holistically with “I’m trying. I can only be myself.” When you say that it makes me feel like the grown ups in the peanuts cartoons, like all you hear is “blah, blah, blah, I’m mad at you, blah, blah, blah” Listening would mean really considering each thing I say and responding to it. \n\n  \n\n\nI pasted my email here and am adding in some questions to see if that helps you absorb and respond to it more directly. The questions I added are not rhetorical, I really want to know what you think about them. If you want to argue or reject the premise of a question, then do that. The important thing to me is feeling like when I tell you stuff you can hear what I’m saying. \n\n  \n\n\nOur relationship isn’t going to magically get better until you’re willing to actually engage and listen and ask me questions about how to make it better. I have been repeatedly trying to start a conversation with you about how we can communicate in ways that take better care of each other, and you keep returning to an assumption that the whole problem is that you should pretend to be cheerful and not talk to me about the divorce.  >>When you want to talk to me like everything is normal, what is the thought process behind that? Do you want to make the issues between us go away, is it painful for you to acknowledge them? It seems counterintuitive to me that in the midst of us not even talking on the phone you wanted to suggest that you visit me, what was your reason for bringing that up now? \n\n  \n\n\nWhen we spoke on the phone last week I tried to say something to you at the start, and you interrupted me and said, “It’s ok, things have been boring so we can just talk.” The thing is, without listening to what I was trying to say to you how could you know that it was ok? I hadn’t talked to you in 6 weeks and then I finally did, it didn’t occur to you that I might not want to just jump back in to small talk?  >>Do you remember that from the beginning of our phone conversation? Do you have any insight into what you were feeling that made you rush past me like that? Did you feel like you knew what I was going to say? If you did, what were you expecting? \n\n  \n\n\nYou keep saying you want to be there for me, the first step is to stop interrupting me or changing the subject when I try to tell you what I need you to do to be there for me. I think maybe your fear of criticism keeps you from listening, because you’re scared of what I might say. If that doesn’t seem true, I wish you would tell me what your perspective is about what's going on.  >>Why do you think you interrupt me or change the subject? Are you scared of me criticizing you? \n\n  \n\n\nYou’ve said several times that you just want things to be more normal, and you don’t want to filter and have to walk on eggshells with me. I definitely get that, but when you’re careless with me and don’t put thought into communicating it means I have to do all the walking on eggshells for both of us.  >>Did you know I feel like I’m walking on eggshells when I talk to you? You say in a lot of your responses that you can only be yourself, or that you don’t want to walk on eggshells. What do you think hearing me say that I feel that way too?   \n  \n\n\nI know it may seem stupid or small to argue over how we communicate when there’s so much to talk about, but I think if we can get better at listening and really responding to each other more specifically, then when we are talking about other stuff it will be a lot easier. \n\n  \n\n\nLove you \n\nMiriam \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nOn Aug 1, 2014, at 10:23 AM, [ nzisook@gmail.com ](mailto:nzisook@gmail.com) wrote: \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nHi M, \n\nOy, the technology... Can you access any sort of technology back-up? It seems overwhelmingly hard to do what you are trying to do without a team. I hope you have a break-through soon. Are you trying to do something that is too hard? Your pattern is usually to worry a lot and then make it all work, but it's a nail-biter until you nail it. I usually don't worry because I know you get overwhelmed at the starts of things- but you really sound worried. I wish I could cheer you up. Ha, in college, I just said take a nice hot shower and go to sleep... It's always better in the morning. Absent any real good advice- I'm rooting for you and have every confidence that you will succeed as you always do. \n\n  \n\n\nMy thumb still hurts and it's late so I won't write long. Ben & Sophie came to dinner. They are so cute. I'm glad Sophie decided to come back early. It's interesting that she was on Birthright under similar circumstances to you. Her trip missed all of their Tel-Aviv time. Luckily we had lots of Tel Aviv time last summer! That was a great trip. I can't wait for another mommy-kid trip, someplace warm in the winter??? \n\n  \n\n\nI really want to go see Liron's baby when it's born. I hope I can make that happen.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nI am still doing laundry but the house is almost back to normal. Lucy has been gone for two weeks and won't be back for another 1.5 weeks... Her kids and grand-kids surprised her by coming to visit from Poland. They will stop by to visit but I am trying to make the house really clean so Lucy doesn't clean while they visit... so it was just me & the biggest pile of laundry I have ever seen. It literally was piled up two feet high all over the laundry room floor I wanted to cry but I just started loading the machine. Now I'm down to just about two more loads, Yay! \n\nI'll write more soon... xox, mom \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n",

You won't all get the connections but Brandt Russell is now a professor at CCM but got there after Joe left so it didn't occur to me to connect them. Bartley (another member of Joe's group) knows him from CCM and it turns out that Joe had a class with him when he was visiting the year before. Brandt is the brother of one of Miriam's best friends- Eleanor... do you get it? probably not, but read on- my right thumb is really sore so I won't try to repeat the stories for each of you... \n\n  \n\n\nI had an interesting week... \n\n  \n\n\nI love having the kids here. I know it sounds like I'm kvetching about laundry but really it is a great joy to take a little bit of extra care of these wonderful kids! And Rochelle's family is a Joy I miss them! Family camp was so peaceful and relaxing. It was so nice to be with all the kids and Grandma and Zayde. The weather was perfect which probably made all the difference because I'm sure 95* and 95% humidity would have killed me... You all do realize that the beautiful cool weather is because 766 Greenleaf is now air conditioned. \n\n  \n\n\nHere's what I just wrote to Miriam- I'm sending it to a group because my thumb is sore and It hurts to type...

   "Message preview": "\n\nHi Mir, \n\nI jammed my right thumb and my right hand is really sore... talking would probably be better. \n\n  \n\n\nSo: \n\n  \n\n\nThis weekend / week was jammed (no pun intended). Got back from family camp Saturday night; Rochelle's family left Sunday morning... did laundry to change the beds for Joe's group all day Sunday... Joe's group got in 1-3 am on Monday morning (Sunday night). Aaron was here and Ben overlapped one night so the high census at 766 Greenleaf was 11. \n\n  \n\n\nHaving the theater group here has been fun. Joe is in his element. I am very proud of him. \n\n  \n\n\nI finally saw the show on Saturday afternoon. It was really well done. They did a great job of telling a story professionally and unpretentiously. You should look at their video and interview on NBC/local. (Link from Joe's Facebook Page.) Every kid in the group is a unique personality and delightful in their own way. I'll be sorry when they go. (Actually, when the linens and towels are all washed and put away, I get the house cleaned up...I'll miss them.) \n\n  \n\n\nSo, yesterday we were talking and it turns out that Joe had a class with Brandt Russell at CCM before he went to CMU... coincidinkee #1... \n\n  \n\n\nSo Joe emailed Brandt and told him he was Mimi's cousin- Brandt wrote back right away and was amused that Joe was so close to where he grew up and told him to go sneak a cigarette at the bridge near his house... I don't think Joe smokers but as you know some smokers like to keep their little secrets. \n\n  \n\n\nBut then- when Kay called this morning I thought she heard about that little story- but no, she just called because Eleanor is in town MOVING HERE!!! and wanted to have dinner with Kay & me tonight- so that's what we'll do. I would love for El to meet Joe, so I hope we can make that happen too... \n\n  \n\n\nIt's a very small world. \n\n  \n\n\ncoincidinkee #2...   \n\n\n  \n\n\nI wish I could make connections like this for everyone: \n\n  \n\n\nFriday morning when I finally had a minute to talk to Joe I told him he should write a nice note to Michael Halberstam, the director of Writers Theater, and introduce himself and invite him to a show... there were only 2 performances remaining... Joe was in PJ's on Friday morning so his \"teammates\" hand delivered a note to Michael by recognizing him on the street (from my description) on their way to Writers Theater. Michael actually showed up at yesterday's matinee performance and invited Joe to meet with him today at 2:30 at Writers Theater. YAY! Imagine where that connection could lead. I know I can be meddlesome and annoying but sometimes it works... \n\n  \n\n\nLast night I had dinner with Brad, Sue, Judith and Dov. It was fun. Not one word about my life- just catching up on everyone's kids, vacations, the situation in Israel. After dinner we walked over to a street fair in Wilmette with a really good rock band and I danced with my friends (in some very sexy new high heels!) I am starting to refer to these happy moments as my \"Eat,Pray,Love\" moments. I hated that book, but I'm starting to feel like there is a whole fun life ahead of me... \n\n  \n\n\nAnyway, I'm doing laundry for the Unexpected Laboratory- They are working their asses off so I thought I would treat them to some unexpected clean laundry before they leave for Winipeg tomorrow. \n\n  \n\n\nI just finished listening to an update on the Israel-Hamas situation from a Young Judaea panel. It was very good to hear really thoughtful relatively unbiased analysis of the horrific situation. \n\n  \n\n\nSo that was my week up until this moment. I have LOTS more laundry... \n\n  \n\n\nLove you, mom \n\n  \n\n\nPS: how I jammed my thumb... That's a story... OK I'll try to write it... \n\nthe short story is that my car got side-swiped by a jerk in a big Chevy \"Humscalade\" on Friday morning... so now my driver's side fender is damaged, my car wheels are out of alignment and my thumb got jammed into the steering wheel. The Police came and didn't give anyone a ticket even though the guy said I hit him - which is possible, but he pulled out of the parking space behind me -after me- and was just an aggressive jerk- I stopped for pedestrians and he didn't. I think he was pissed and swooped around too fast... it will be aggravating dealing with car repairs and insurance on top of all of the other aggravations but at least I am not really hurt- just my thumb which is swollen and a little bluish-red. This sort of thing really makes me appreciate the significance of opposable thumbs- and car insurance. But the world is way too filled with JERKS! It turns out that there was a witness who told the Police she saw the whole thing and it was my fault! so when the Police went back to interview her, guess what- she had the same last name as the Chevy driver and was his wife!!! (a small factoid she tried to hide from the Police...) OY! I don't think the police took too kindly to her attempted deception and that was after he told me he wouldn't give me a ticket because it was unclear who hit who... \n\n  \n\n\nSo to end on a more positive note- I had a great week overall and really enjoy having a full house! \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nHi kid, \n\nI am a pretty happy camper. I don't exactly know what I did all day but I was busy... the days are going by faster even though these are the longest days of the year. That must be good. Jonathan was amazing. He is a born performer. My parking space was too good to be true- it was too close to a hydrant- but luckily there was a valet parking guy right across the street- so I decided to still be a princess. It's Shabbat so you won't get this til later. Tomorrow I'm going to go meet Rebecca in Milwaukee for \"Battle of the Bands\" at Summerfest. Jonathan is amazing- he's a born Rock star. Total triple threat. It's so wonderful to see him so happy and in his element. Becca is a proud mommy and happy for her baby! \n\n  \n\n\nI think Barbara's words were something like \"you'll be divorced but the kids really won't be.\" Even though her dad moved away and they didn't talk much if at all- she just wishes things were normal. She also sees how hard her divorce was on her kids- they were little. I think there was a lot of shame back then that doesn't so much exist anymore. Also not so many people got divorced. We're talking mid-Mad Men sixties and early 70's. I remember there was only one kid in my whole class of 21 kids whose parents were divorced... I think that Barbara was reaching out to me because people did not so much reach out to her mom. I also think Barbara and Joni had to be their mom's whole world because she lost her whole extended family and many social opportunities - women just did not go out \"stag\" back then. I think it was a big deal that we invited Tybe to your Bat Mitzvah- she hadn't been invited to a Zisook family event in over 25 years by then... Yikes- and I am overrun by Zisooks... so really Barbara's story and how well and her mom did under vastly worse circumstances should really make us all feel lucky. That said, it still sucks for all of us in different ways. For me it 's mostly about having to really think about the choices I will have and what will guide them- I think everyone has existential questions- I just think you get to answer them gradually. The suddenness and unpredictability of my situation and how out of my control everything is is just crazy-making. 8/4 is because we filed a petition in court to get Dad to pay for stuff and the hearing date is on 8/4. That's the Court process... it takes forever to get anything done. At this rate global warming will consume Florida before we are divorced... but at least I will have air conditioning! \n\n  \n\n\nluck for me, I only have the perspective of the wife- it seems unlikely that Bubbe and Papa would split up at this point- If it happenedI think it would make me feel like nothing was real. I would look back and re-remember things to fit the current f.o.g. I can't even go there... I know Gil and I would probably compare notes a lot and try to figure out if our memories matched up and if we missed any signs. I think there's a gap in support for people in your category, \"Meeting tonight: All kids whose parents divorce after they are grown-ups...\" there just aren't so many of you out there although it it seems it is very trendy now and I am in the newly fastest growing segment of the divorcing population. I think the support groups will be popping up like mushrooms soon. I bet there are all sorts of people in cyber space talking about some very specific issue and finding people with the exact same issue... In Barbara's day divorce was really rare and even rarer in the circles she was living in- I think most people with grown kids still stick it out whether they are happy or not. But it seems more and more look into the future and see 30 more good years and wonder if they want those years to be happy. It used to be that at 57 you really only had a few good years left and you would just stick around to take care of each other... who knows? Anyway, I think I'm trendy and maybe even cutting edge... I am very very supported and you and the boys run across people in your life who have similar stories and dramatically more DRAMA even. \n\n  \n\n\nSo that's the long answer to what I think made Barbara say what she said- there are so many differences- I could go on and on... Another bad thing was that uncle Dave and his brothers had lost the Real Estate business and Tybe did not have much to live on in the beginning. I think Uncle Dave was in pretty bad shape financially even though Tybe didn't know things were bad- Barbara's theory is that he just sort of cracked up because he went from riches to rags when the South Side tanked... \n\n  \n\n\nIt's getting harder to feel to sorry for myself when I hear other people's stories. I think I should eventually calm down and get used to watching the grass grow- and florida to disappear... \n\n  \n\n\nOK I better get some sleep if I'm going to be a teen-ager and go to a Rock n Roll \"fest\" tomorrow. I think my last outdoor Rock Concert may have been Pink Floyd. (except Ravinia which does not count.) Summer Fest is HUGE even huger than LollaPalooza apparently. but way cheaper... \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nLove you, \n\n  \n\n\nWriting like this is a little embarrassing because I go on and on the way I talk... I'm not sure if I am making any sense and I hate going back to re-read even though the whole point is to spare you from my \"vortex of Divorce.\" I just can't stand reading what I write... so click-send- thanks for listening... xox \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\na long there is no ritual for divorce- especially for adult children of divorce \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n",

Had lunch with Barbara she listened to the short version of our story- and shared her experience of both being divorced and the adult daughter of divorced parents. She encouraged me to stay tough but she said in the long run it may be harder to be the child than the divorcee. Her kids were very young when she was divorced and she had kids by the time her Dad left her mom. Considering what she went through I should feel lucky! I think the times were different and Tybe (Barbara's mom) lost her extended Zisook family because in the olden days it was not proper to be loyal to the ex the way Dad's family has been. So I can't complain. \n\n  \n\n\nI hope I end up half as vibrant and beautiful as Tybe at 94 or Barbara at 70ish. It was so overwhelmingly kind of Barbara to reach out to me.

It’s great that you get to see Sharon, Becca, and so much family, all in such a short time, but I understand that it's also a little tiring. I’m sad Sharon isn’t happy in Oklahoma, but glad you’ll have company for a while. I’m also really glad Ellis is doing better, and with Cameron’s surgery behind him he seems really great too. It’s so good to see those kids doing better. How long will they be in MN? And Ben, completing the triathlon is amazing! He’s so awesome. \n\n  \n\n\nI’ve been busy with Kavod stuff and work. It seems like we may have found a new Kavod house, which would be really really amazing news. If we get the house we’re trying to get, it would be perfect for us in so many ways. And, it would have the very positive side effect for me of meaning we don’t have to keep dealing with Havurat Shalom, which I would be happy not to have to worry about anymore. All in all I’m really excited about being Kavod president, the leadership lined up for next year is awesome, both in terms of skills and also in terms of being really fun. Tonight I’m speaking at a group called “Quantified Self XX,” which is a women and technology group focused in particular on self-tracking and personal health type stuff. I’m excited for that, and also a little nervous. It’s the same material as my stats project from earlier this year, so hopefully it will go well. \n\n  \n\n\nWhat did cousin Barbara say to you?

I am having a hard time keeping my mind on fiction. I think I need something real to read. The dog sounds great. I keep thinking that I need a dog even though the big dog you gave me makes me happy and stays in my bed and doesn't shed or pee all over and doesn't chew up my shoes. I think he might like a companion- hopefully one that doesn't chew on him. I prefer medium \"real\" dogs but probably should get an itty-bitty dog that can go on airplanes. I look at the shelter web sites but haven't seen any little dogs with no issues yet. The last thing I need right now is a dog with \"issues.\" Can you imagine anxious me with an anxious dog??? I need a sweet little \"chill\" dog that is just happy to hang around and cuddle. \n\n  \n\n\nI hope your technology is cooperating better now.

Ellis seems great. He is over six feet tall, still beautiful and seems to be in a good place. I went over to say hi and he was so friendly and gave me a big hug- a really nice \"I mean-it\" hug. He was also smiling and laughing more than I've seen in years. He turns 18 on July 8th- and may be turning a corner. I hope so. dawn and Michael have been through so much. His school seems really excellent, and if I could remember the name of it I would suggest that you connect with it somehow. They seem to be doing some innovative things. \n\n  \n\n\nBen came back and I had dinner with him and ice cream which was fun then we blew up at each other on the way to the Linden L. I hope all of you understand that I am stressed out- trying to do everything right for everyone and still getting a lot wrong. It's a process- I want to feel in control of some things. I think you all understand but also have some need for control. I am not used to taking control but I am getting much better at asserting myself and knowing what I need. I still get really tired in the afternoons and nap almost every day- I don't know if that's good or bad. I'm trying to eat healthy so I am not losing weight any more.

They will stay over tomorrow night and then I will drive them downtown on Thursday morning. I have a lawyer meeting then I am meeting Barbara (dad's cousin) for lunch at the Arts club for lunch. I don't know if you remember how lovely it was that Barbara and her sister Joanie reached out to me when Dad left. They were adults when their father, Uncle Dave, left their mom. I think Barbara is reaching out to tell me that things will be OK. I think that's really nice of her and I look forward to our date. Really, she is your counterpart in this so she may give me some perspective on what it feels like to be the kids in this situation, even though she is now about 65 and a grandmother. Her mom is one of the most beautiful and gracious women- still at 95! \n\n  \n\n\nJuly Fourth weekend is fast approaching and I'm pretty ambivalent about the family retreat. Mostly because I like the comforts of home. Rochelle's whole family will stay here for 1-2 nights before- YIKES!!! then when we get back Joey's theater company will stay here. Half were going to stay at Grandma Merle's but she is not really up to it so I will take all 8-10 of them. I will probably have to see grandma Merle for because she will want to see Joe- I'll make the best of that silliness. It will be nice to have a full house and finally having the AC makes me a lot less stressed out about house guests. \n\n  \n\n\nThere is a good chance Sharon will come to stay for a while in August. She has been pretty depressed on Oklahoma and called yesterday to ask if she could stay here for a while. Things are OK with Fred- she just needs a break after 5 years in bible-thumping right-wing conservative land. I think we will have a blast together so I hope she comes but I'm sorry she is so unhappy in Oklahoma. If Sharon comes, I will recruit her to help me find a dog and house-break it... that could be a real hoot. Sharon always had dogs with \"issues.\" \n\n  \n\n\nToday my lawyers worked really hard but now that we're back in the court system things will be very slow and frustrating. Tomorrow morning papers will be flying all over the Cook County Court but nothing will get decided for a while. I am getting used to the non-rhythm of nothing happening. I don't like to write if I'm feeling down-ish but there you are- I just want the system to be fair and get so nervous that it won't be. \n\n  \n\n\nOn the positive side, I have suddenly gotten quite a few inquiries about calligraphy jobs. The one I just finished paid for groceries this week- YAY! I also enjoyed the zen of sitting at my desk and just making beautiful envelopes...it was like playing scales in music and I keep getting better at it. I had to skip beading today because of my court petitions but I worked on a really pretty bracelet with an intricate pattern until I broke the thread and could not rethread the needle and gave up. I need to get needles with bigger eyes- the one I have is ridiculous and it was a miracle I threaded it the first time. OK- this is boring for you to read... Dawn gave me a piano lesson and was pretty impressed that I can actually play by ear. The method she is working on is impressive. I had an epiphany about music because of her approach. I'll tell you more about it when I figure more out. Mostly she teaches by steps and progressions rather than notes, to start. It's like learning the theory and then seeing how the notes fit in. The keys are really much more analogous to colors and I get color theory, so I feel like thinking about music within the schema I understand makes sense for me in a way that reading notes really didn't. I probably won't spend much time playing though because there are so many things I like to do more and are easier to feel successful at. Music is HARD and it takes so much effort to be good at it- I have to hand it to Ben, he is really doing something hard! and how about that race??? Ben is really impressive, all of you are! Aaron has been the voice of _reason and calm_ and I am so proud of the way he is approaching all of his transitions lately. \n\n  \n\n\nI watched the movie The Grand Budhapest Hotel. I love Wes Anderson movies- they are so beautiful; every frame is a painting- even though I'm not really sure where he is going with some of the stories and characters. \n\n  \n\n\nSo that's the latest non-news from Glencoe. Hope all's well in Somerville! \n\n  \n\n\nLove you, \n\nmommy \n\n  \n\n\nps: sending without editing... just looked at the time...   \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n",

It was about women (Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Edwards, Michelle Obama and Sarah Palin) in the 2008 election. I really like the women in my book club. Also, my next door neighbor has been lending me her dog, which is amazing. I have keys to her house and I can borrow the dog whenever I want.

   "Message preview": "\n\nDear Children, \n\nI had high hopes that Dad and I could resolve our divorce in mediation rather than Court. It seems that it would have been more civilized, dignified and private that way. Unfortunately, I just learned from our mediator that Dad is opting out of further mediation. \n\n  \n\n\nThis means that the Court process will be a lengthy, _public_ one and could ultimately end in a trial several months from now. You will be able to follow the interim proceedings and rulings on-line if you choose to. \n\n  \n\n\nI don't relish the Court process but I know I can handle it (I've watched enough Law  & Order) and ultimately, the goal is for things to be \"just & equitable.\" So that is what I will expect. In reality, the best result will be equally \"unfair\" in court or mediation, the only difference is that it will cost more to get there. I have no doubt that mediation would have spared us all so much time aggravation, embarrassment and money; but it was not my choice. \n\n  \n\n\nYou are the best kids and shouldn't have to go through any of this. I thought I couldn't spare you this news because from now on the filings will be a matter of public record. And since Ben is still in College, he will be directly involved so you will want to be there to help support him. \n\n  \n\n\nNothing really changes on a day-to-day basis, Nevertheless I thought you should hear it from me right away. You have all proven that you are strong and resilient- so hang in there. We will all be fine in the end, no matter what. Promise!   \n\n\n  \n\n\nI love you all so much, \n\n  \n\n\nMommy \n\n  \n\n\nPS: Molly, My lawyer will be speaking directly with Ben but any of you can call her if you want to understand any of this in greater detail. I'm sure you can also contact Dad or his lawyer if you want to understand how court is different from mediation. xox \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nDear darling kids whom I love! \n\n  \n\n\nI will be representing us on Fathers day with Zayde, which will be nice. I hope you have a regular-ish day on Sunday, but sometime during the day it might creep in that this is not normal for you and you may feel sad. I don't want to generate any extra sadness by  suggesting  this because I really don't know how any of you will feel- and you may all process the day differently. I hesitated before writing this email at all because Fathers Day is really about each person and their father. However since it's mostly a Hallmark Holiday and not really vested with any deep meaning- I wanted to remind you of that too. While I like the extra attention on Mothers Day it's sort of a weird mix of corny and an excuse to demand attention. It was, for me one day when I felt like I could get people to do what I wanted to do with no apologies. My last Mother's day was the best one ever though. So I guess I am ambivalent about these holidays all together... \n\n  \n\n\nI am sending it today so you can just block it out by Sunday and forget I sent it. I anticipate being hurt, sad and angry that you kids _might_ have even one sad moment on Fathers Day or will mourn the loss of \"normal.\" \n\n  \n\n\nMy strategy will be to focus on the GREAT fathers we still are lucky to have and pay special attention to Papa and Zayde! I also will be grateful for the other really good men and fathers in your lives. I hope you remember to call Papa and Zayde and tell them how much more they mean to you than ever before. \n\n  \n\n\nI also hope that you can  remember the good times and not remember dad as he is now. \n\nM: when you were born Dad woke up at 5 every morning so he could hold you and cuddle you at the hospital every day on the way to work. When we got home from the hospital he wanted your cradle on his side of the bed. \n\nA: Dad would sit in front of the \"rube Goldberg\" machine at the Museum of Science and Industry for as long as it still made you laugh when the ball finally popped out. \n\nB: Dad encouraged you and supported you whatever your passion was. He gladly bought you a fancy bike (over my strenuous objection) and now look what you've done with that passion. He always wanted the best for you. \n\n  \n\n\nHe took you all on amazing trips and wanted you to see the world and experience the open road. As weird as this all is, I believe that there is a good soul in there that is just protecting itself from shame by being hard and prickly- for right now. Sure dad did some bad things, we all know it. Him most of all. He is very proud of all of you and wants to measure up to you- I think. \n\n  \n\n\nReally, Dad always wanted the best for all of us. Something along the way went terribly wrong and we may never figure out what happened, or when he changed but I was happy, I loved him and he had great moments with all of you. I hope in the long run, you will remember those more, and that this year will fade into the background of what may become better and deeper relationships. \n\n  \n\n\nIt seems like I have gotten way closer to Papa than I have ever been before, Zayde too. I have also discovered great fathers in unexpected places. \n\n  \n\n\nSo, I don't want to upset you- burn the email if I have- but I thought I'd share my verse from the \"tie\" song. (I'll admit I wrote some raunchier and meaner lines along the way.) Maybe you will smile and think of better times! \n\n  \n\n\nI love you all so much and hope that I am over-anticipating any sort of grief on Sunday... Love, love, love, Mother! \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n_ T  oday Albert is Fathers day  _\n\n_and I'm just not gonna lie_\n\n_You’re such a sad show_\n\n_And I don’t really know you but_\n\n_I wish you were a regular guy_\n\n_For years you’ve been nothing but bother_\n\n_For you I just don’t want to fuss_\n\n_so instead of celebrating Father_\n\n_We’re just celebrating us_\n\n_yes we’re just celebrating us._\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nOK, lame, but I wanted to say/do something ritual... and hope you can all sing the real \"tie\" song soon! \n\n  \n\n\nLove to all and happy Saturday, Shabbat Shalom. \n\nmom \n\n  \n\n\nPS: There is going to be a new sit com on ABC? called something like \"Welcome to Sweden\" It could be hysterically funny-  possibly  to the two of us... I am convinced if you have 18 hour nights for any part of the year, you better be funny to  compensate. \n",

Dad has just locked up what is ours so he alone decides how the money is spent now, while legally we should have equal access to cash. \n\nIt's hard to think about anything else when Dad acts out almost every day.

Â I don't think it's a big deal and I don't really see the crime in paying the rent once it's overdue... \n\n  \n\n\nLove you, MOM \n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nThat's exactly what I suggested to Ben. I knew Ben could get the rent check when he is there next week. That said, I just wrote to my lawyers so now the ball is in the air... \n\n  \n\n\nAlso, while I want to just get Ben's rent paid efficiently, It is important to hold dad to his commitments because he wrestled control over Ben's rent from me by \"agreement\" so if I pay Ben's rent it could be construed as a violation of a filed written agreement regarding Ben's rent and support. My lawyers suggest that I not take on any of dad's responsibilities that he has not held his end on. ( _If you want to know which other issues are pending in this regard, ask me._ )   \n\n\n  \n\n\nBen is still getting an auto draft from my account for his allowance every week which I was supposed to cancel but didn't (so far no complaints from Dad- he has seen the bank statements.) \n\n  \n\n\nI tried very hard to address Ben's needs and Aaron's on Thursday. I got nowhere except that Dad agreed to pay for Ben's Tuition and expenses through College as part of the final divorce agreement. This was an automatic thing that the mediator was able to add because Dad is legally responsible for Ben, he knows it, the courts know it and ultimately he will take responsibility. I will always have all of your backs and will cover your needs no matter what happens- as long as I am able- which I will be once the dust settles because I will have some liquidity, but not a lot. If you want a detailed explanation about what I know about the finances, I can tell you, but I'm not sure I understand that much. \n\n  \n\n\nI think Ben is angry at me- I am doing the best I can here! \n\n  \n\n\nLove you both! \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n",

   "Message preview": "Hi Mom \n\n  \n\n\nIâ€™ll write more later responding to this, but in the meantime I just talked to Ben and I wanted to suggest something. \n\n  \n\n\nGiven that the rent is time sensitive, but the check made out to Ben thatâ€™s sitting in his apartment isnâ€™t so time sensitive, I think you should write a check to Benâ€™s landlord and Ben should ask his roommates to mail him the check from Dad and he can pay you back once it arrives. This will at least get the rent paid. \n\n  \n\n\nSince the mediation already settled on Dad paying Benâ€™s rent, it should work out in the long run, but at least in the short run you can show Ben he has parental support even if Dad is being an asshole. Itâ€™s important he feel like youâ€™ve got his back, and in the end the one monthâ€™s rent getting paid wonâ€™t make or break the bank for you. Also, it will stick it to dad to know that he canâ€™t force Ben to engage him with tho strategy, because you and Ben are a united front. \n\n  \n\n\nOn the topic of toughening up or putting a time limit on grieving, you canâ€™t be in a place youâ€™re not ready to be. Just be gentle with yourself and know that healing and moving on is going to take time. \n\n  \n\n\nThatâ€™s my 2 cents.

   "Message preview": "Hi - wow the retreat sound like a huge success and fun. You are an awesome gentle leader and the Kavod community is lucky to have you. I'm so happy you are part of a lively Jewish Community. I am also so proud of the way you are managing to balance it all. You are such a fine grown-up. \n\nI had 6 Israelis for the weekend- so I ran a great B&B for a few days. The last kids just left. They were awesome- incredibly nice and it was a joy to pamper them before they headed off to hard work and living conditions at camp. \n\nBob & Sue stopped by and stayed for dinner (leftovers) on Saturday night. Yesterday I drove the Israelis to Six Flags and stopped at Gurnee mills for more size 6 clothes- it's nuts but nothing in my closet fits me! I like my size but the stress is not great. Then Susie, Chloe and 3 Israelis watched the Tony Awards with me. That was nice and I forgot about everything for a few hours. \n\nLast week was the worst- I think I am just so hurt even though I know I need to move on and toughen up. The thing that hurts the most is how little Dad seems to care and how little he thinks I deserve after so long. I don't want you to worry because I have some limited trust that the lawyers will make things work out -though it's hard to see how. I know this has been a huge ordeal and great disappointment for you A&B. I try to think about what I can do to make the hurt go away. I think you are all doing so much better than me. That makes me proud. You have been wiser and more supportive than kids should be. It's hard in the \"trenches\" I wish I was less emotional. My strategy of being grateful for what I have doesn't work perfectly. Really it's just how hurt I am that I cared so much and dad seems to be protecting himself from caring at all. I tell myself it's just his way of coping but I want him to realize that I deserve better. I want to realize it myself too. But I'm still trying to get by and though some of the \"adventures in Divorce\" may seem comical in the future, the aggression now is wearing me down. Last Wednesday and Thursday took everything out of me. I asked Bubbe & Papa for a loan so the day to-day stress may get relieved. I just was so sad to have them worry about me. They worked so hard and saved so carefully that I find it shameful to ask them to have to support me when that it what a marriage is supposed to be about- even a dissolving one. I guess the pact between parents and their children trumps all and I hope that one day you kids have two parents that would do anything for you. \n\nThe weather today is GLORIOUS!!! I have some legal homework to do and then I think I will go get some flats of impatiens to plant in the yard. \n\n  \n\n\nI'm a little weepy though and my therapist is on vacation. I think I will put a time-limit on the grieving. Hope this isn't more than you want to hear- it actually feels good to write- even if I'm getting a few tears on the phone. \n\n  \n\n\nI love you and I'm so proud. I want to know how all of this feels to you, if you feel like it, write me. But if you can detach in a good healthy way that's better. I want you kids to be there for eachother- \n\n  \n\n\nBtw: do have your strategy in place for getting to the Michigan Thing for Grandma & Zayde? I don't think that it's a requirement for you to be there- I am a little bit sorry I said I would go, but Zayde and Grandma N have been so wonderful to me and I don't take it for granted that the Zisooks are keeping me close. \n\n  \n\n\nWow, that was long...

   "Message preview": "Dear Miriam, cc: Aaron & Ben \n\n  \n\n\nSometimes my words get all jumbled up... I'm writing down what I really mean about talking to dad. \n\n  \n\n\nI don't want to encourage you either way about talking to dad. It is your choice. That said-  Later on, down the road I just don't EVER want to hear that I did, or said anything to discourage you. And that when I thought it was in your best interest, I encouraged you to call him. \n\n  \n\n\nEvery story has more than one side. If I have encouraged you to talk to dad it was only so you could understand (and not tell me) what he is going through. I mean it- NOT TELL ME. i cannot have contact with dad, even second hand... \n\n  \n\n\nI know that \"estrangements\" take a terrible toll on families. You have two parents who love you. Dad may have changed over the years. But he was not always where he was for the last # of years. He may find balance- especially with some care. Dad needs counseling and he must be honest with his therapist. I DON'T think it is your role to deliver that message. In fact I discourage you from getting involved that way. \n\n  \n\n\nAs far as I know Dad or possibly just his lawyer has turned on me aggressively. But he has not turned on you. It is _**not your job** _ to protect me from, or deflect any of dad's behavior toward me. Though I occasionally tell you what's happening- please know that the lawyers -and my therapist- will deal with all of it and I will come out whole. I just tell you the things that happen in my day... I will try to edit out the rough stuff but basically, not much else is happening of much consequence... This is what \"I'm up to...\" I do have nice days though... \n\n  \n\n\nWe will all help each other get through this by being compassionate and kind with each other but we are each responsible for our own decisions. \n\n  \n\n\nI think it IS actually important for you to understand the \"narcissistic\" state Dad is in currently and avoid certain issues if/when you talk to dad. If you need advice on this- ask Your therapists- Susie is also very wise on this issue and can help. \n\n  \n\n\nI hope that writing this while I am still half asleep isn't a mistake. And that writing what I actually mean to say makes things better- not worse! \n\n  \n\n\nEvery morning when I wake up I do some \"grieving\" and then I move on and try to have a nice day... This is my grieving time. \n\n  \n\n\n**My only wish ever is that my children will be happy-**\n\n  \n\n\nI wish I could have done something to protect you from what is happening. But I raised you to be strong and resilient people with good judgement. You know- my biggest gold-star for \"parenting\" is that you all passed the NTHS Consumer Test! So you must have some practical common sense! You are magnificent adults and have supported me through the worst days of my life- I am sorry I leaned on you so heavily. But- I raised you resilient- spring back and grow stronger. \n\n  \n\n\nOne more thing- you will all inevitably blame me for being a \"victim\" or for not defending myself... For being weak and for allowing this to happen to our family. I wish I knew what was happening - I finally understand what Grandma Selma was saying when she said she \"woke -up.\" I will never see myself as a victim. I am Bubbe's daughter and I will be a survivor. Regrets won't actually help. \n\n  \n\n\nWhen you get angry at me, please be gentle, I love you all so much and envy the chance you are all having to grow up and self-actualize. You are the loves of my life. I would never say anything hurtful intentionally. If my words don't make sense now and come out wrong- nothing makes much sense.. I'm trying to get help to be myself again- until then I am confused- bear with me, I get better every day. \n\n  \n\n\nLove, love, love, \n\nMom \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n.....   \nSent from [ Mailbox ](https://www.dropbox.com/mailbox) for iPhone \n",

   "Message preview": "\n\nDear Kendra, \n\n  \n\n\nYour words were so beautiful and captured Unclynn... so well. I am honored that you added my email- really your's was such a beautiful tribute, it hardly needed anything else. I am glad I wrote when Lynn could still- I hope-know how I felt about him. He left such a mark on our lives and definitely on this little town of Glencoe... His was the quintessential \"life well lived.\" I have bumped into many people in the past few days who knew Lynn. I wish I could capture  & convey to you the way he was thought of around here and how much a part of this town he was- even after they moved away- luckily I think you have a good sense of that. \n\n  \n\n\nI was such a fish out of water at the Muskie show yesterday. I'm glad I went though-I never knew that Muskie's like so many pretty shiny things! Also I found out that Lake Vermillion Minnesota is like a \"world capital\" of Muskie fishing!!! Guess what, My next door neighbors Dawn and Michael are just finishing up building a big giant house-with a boat house on Lake Vermillion- Dawn and Michael know Ruth and Lynn (we were all together on Halloween) so any time you feel like a little trip to Lake Vermillion- I am _sure_ you will be welcome! Of course, you know I still have a big old house- practically on Lake Michigan, I would love to have you all visit this spring- or any time. \n\n  \n\n\nRuth- at the very least, let's you and I go visit Dawn this summer!!! And you know you are welcome to stay at my B &B. \n\n  \n\n\nI hope yesterday was beautiful. You are such a beautiful family, how could it not be? \n\n  \n\n\nLove to all, I'm glad I got to be there- at least in writing... \n\n  \n\n\nMuch, much love, \n\nNitza \n\n  \n\n\nps: I hope it's OK that I shared your eulogy with my kids ... and some other family... If you read other messages after mine, please send them. & other words that people said- when you have time. I hope the days ahead are restful! \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n",

Line bottoms with rounds of wax paper and grease paper.   \nFinely chop chocolate and in a bowl combine with hot coffee. Let mixture stand, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.   \nInto a large bowl sift together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In another large bowl with an electric mixer beat eggs until thickened slightly and lemon colored (about 3 minutes with a standing mixer or 5 minutes with a hand-held mixer). Slowly add oil, buttermilk, vanilla, and melted chocolate mixture to eggs, beating until combined well. Add sugar mixture and beat on medium speed until just combined well. Divide batter between pans and bake in middle of oven until a tester inserted in center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.   \nCool layers completely in pans on racks. Run a thin knife around edges of pans and invert layers onto racks. Carefully remove wax paper and cool layers completely. Cake layers may be made 1 day ahead and kept, wrapped well in plastic wrap, at room temperature.   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nGourmet   \nMarch 1999   \n(null)   \n  \nWant to see how other cooks rated and reviewed this recipe?

When sugar syrup reaches boil, start beating whites with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until frothy, then add lemon juice and beat at medium speed until whites just hold soft peaks. (Do not beat again until sugar syrup is ready.)   \nMeanwhile, put candy thermometer into sugar syrup and continue boiling until syrup reaches 238–242°F. Immediately remove from heat and pour into a heatproof 1-cup glass measure. Slowly pour hot syrup in a thin stream down side of bowl into egg whites, beating constantly at high speed. Beat meringue, scraping down bowl with a rubber spatula, until meringue is cool to the touch, about 6 minutes. (It’s important that meringue is properly cooled before proceeding.)   \nWith mixer at medium speed, gradually add butter 1 piece at a time, beating well after each addition until incorporated. (If meringue is too warm and buttercream looks soupy after some of butter is added, briefly chill bottom of bowl in a large bowl filled with ice water for a few seconds before continuing to beat in remaining butter.) Continue beating until buttercream is smooth. (Mixture may look curdled before all of butter is added, but will come back together before beating is finished.) Add vanilla and beat 1 minute more.   \n  \n  \n  \nCooks' note:   \n Buttercream can be made 1 week ahead and chilled, covered, or frozen 1 month.

   "Message preview": "\n\nDear Ruth, I wrote to you last night at 1:00 am but somehow sent the note back to Nancy instead of to you and Lynn. I dreamt about the two of you last night. We were outside on the side of your your house on Mary street. Lynn had just put in the last stake to build a tent- he was smiling his \"Lynn\" smile- the kids yours, mine, and others ... piled in- it was sort of like a clown car-with way too many kids to fit in the tent! I can't remember if anything like that ever happened for real- maybe it did with a hammock or something else... Anyway, here's what I wrote last night: \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nDear Ruth and Lynn, \n\n  \n\n\nI am writing through tears. I don't have words to describe what uncle Lynn has meant to all of us. He is the epitome of kindness, warmth and authenticity. The way he lives his life is a blessing and model for me and my kids. His involvement in the community and ability to quietly assert leadership with care and thoughtfulness, gently and with strength- has left a lasting imprint on our little town and so many many lives. His great love for you, his children and grand children, and the joy with which he pursued every hobby, volunteer commitment and craft was thrilling. He told great stories and was a compassionate listener. \n\nNo matter what he had on his mind, he always made me feel loved, understood and supported. The twinkle in his eyes in quiet moments always made me smile He is a strong, solid man with rock-solid values we all can aspire to. And he gave the best hugs ever. \n\nThe last few weeks have been crazy for me and the kids. I can't tell you how much a hug from Lynn would have helped- I know it would have been the most comforting of all. \n\nI wish there was something I could say or do to make this new phase in his life peaceful and comforting? His is a full life. He has brought so much joy to so many of us. I hope he always knows how very much loved he is and how unforgettable he is. \n\nRuth, I wish I could have a tiny shred of the epic love you and Lynn share. I can't begin to imagine what it must feel like to escort Lynn through the days ahead. I hope the time you spend together is blessed and that the people around you bring comfort and joy. \n\nI am sending hugs from all of us to You, Lynn, Todd  & Kendra, Jay and Liz and all of the grand kids. Again, I wish I could be there to have just one more hug from Lynn! \n\n  \n\n\nWith love and good cheer from snowy but very pretty Glencoe. \n\nLove, Love, love always, \n\nNitza \n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nPs: please give Lynn a big hug From all of us. And tell him how much I need one back!   \n\n\n.....   \nSent from [ Mailbox ](https://www.dropbox.com/mailbox) for iPhone \n\n  \nOn Wednesday, January 1, 2014, Zisook Nancy wrote:   \n\n",

I'm sure once my body remembers how to sleep- I will go back to just being regular-tired and regular-sleeping.  \nReally-  last night was great.  I was fine home alone. Sniffr dog kept me company.  You are the best daughter in the world.  You did a great thing coming here.  Now I want to be the mom again!  No daughter should ever have to do what you did- (so graciously and lovingly). Just please be a strong sibling unit with your baby brothers. My issues are different from yours- so help yourselves and eachother- I didn't think I could love you more than I already did- but the last week has deepened my respect and admiration for the woman you are. I probably shouldn't take too much credit, you were born kind and compassionate ( I can tell you many stories from preschool and before) but for now- it's good for my fledgling self esteem to take some credit for your beauty and grace. I had a magnificent conversation with Aaron last night.  Wow-  he's so sincere and has so much wisdom.  Have a fantastic day.  I am moving on.  I think today will feel like a regular day for me- finally.  Love you. Mommy",

I've decided to leave my grad program. I have been really unhappy with it especially for the last few months and it felt like time to step back and reevaluate. Technically, I've taken a leave of absence so if I want to go back I can, but I'm doubtful. I'm hoping this decision is going to make me feel a lot freer and happier and it will be easier to be a gaged with the family and other parts of life when I'm not wasting so much energy on the dysfunction of school.

Her Dad was a kind gentle soul and he was so sweet to me always- just because I was Becca's friend.  He died very suddenly.  It was inspiring to hear such wonderful stories about his life.  It was hard to leave Chicago but I'm glad I came.  Aaron & I fly back together tomorrow.  I wish you would come home for a few days.  I'll spoil and baby you if you do-  after December 23rd my divorce case will be essentially done and I can just breathe and relax- I think I may go on a binge watching binge!  Love you,\nMommy",

Working on it.  I took Aaron to visit my Bubbe & Zayde's grave.  All in all, including Dad's deposition, it was the most emotional week in over a year... Then we flew home.  I had a melt-down, Aaron was very insightful and helped me see some of the patterns I am in especially with you 3.  Who knew that Aaron would be so right about my emotions.  AARON, I could not be more proud of you. I have a lot of growing up to do.  I miss you all.  M COME HOME when the boys are here!!! Maybe it will be nice- could be AWFUL- never know until we try... I love you all so much-  Ben what's up? did a Trombone choose you???  Catch me up. When do you come home?  So far, Aaron and I are going to Susie's on Christmas Day- who else? The movie decision is tough though- my vote is Annie but I'm totally outnumbered.  Maybe we should curl up at home and watch The Princess Bride- or brave little toaster... Miss you all except Aaron who is HERE- badly in need of protection from too much of me!!!",

I understand your not wanting to engage but it is unrealistic to not at least try to understand and process some of the upheaval in our family together.  I want to understand your feelings and I want you to understand mine. I want to break old patterns.   So much has happened and I have so many huge decisions to make.  Your opinions and attitude matter to me as i weigh the options.  \n\nThe divorce process that started 12/2/13 is winding down.  These weeks have been rougher than the beginning. I have done my best to stay strong and dignified.  The last 15 months have taken a huge toll.  No, it was not my choice to lose 50 lbs. on the stress/misery diet.  The added pressure of not living up to your expectations-and not even knowing what they are- is exhausting me more than practically anything. You seem to jump to judge me without actively listening to my perspective.  I know you don't mean to criticize but your fast negative responses to almost anything I say hurt me. \n\nYour comments about the house were just plain mean.  This is still my home. I don't have to justify my need to give myself time to decide where I will live and what i will do.  If you have strong feelings about the house just tell me; as always i will balance your feelings with the boys' and my own.  \n\nYou have an opportunity to be kind and compassionate- I don't want to create too much scar tissue in our relationship.\n\nI have tried hard to give you time and space but I am sad that you don't trust me.  I prefer a more positive supportive approach both ways. I prefer just talking.  Our conversations might be emotional- we're family.  Your treatment of me is out of character for the kind, compassionate person i know you are. Love, mom\n\nI don't like texting.",

Taxis work but Lift would be quicker, more congenial and probably cheaper.

Maybe, since you have connections in the industry, you could figure something out.  This is a VASTLY growing market. \n...Nancy and Zayde aren't doing great.  Zayde is using a cane and seems quite unsteady on his feet.  They can't travel at all.  They ask about you constantly.  It would light up their days to get phone calls from you...

If you are planning to go, I'll pay you back for airfare but PLEASE book ASAP definitely before November 1st because the fares go nuts- they are already very high.  I am planning to take the non-stop United flight from Chicago on December 18, if it's still available and reasonable... If not I'll go earlier, or make a stop.  Ben & Sophie- if you plan to go, maybe we can fly together. If anyone wants to come through Chicago, either a few days ahead, or to connect at ORD- cool, we can fly on the same flight...\nI need to know if you are planning to come, and for how long.  I'm thinking I wIll stay with Bubbe & Papa and get rooms for whoever wants them at a nearby hotel, maybe Colony Palms. \nSo please look at flights and get back to me- ASAP because I will base the length of my stay on your dates... And I want to book my travel this week. Also, heads up... Nathan's Bar Mitzvah will be in May...I'm happy we have lots to celebrate!  LOTS!!!!  \nLove to all of you!\nMom \nPS: it will be beautiful in Palm Springs... Sunny & warm every day.  Think about a great escape from the cold-",

You are a wonderful person Nitza. You have such a big heart, such a smart and canny mind, such grace. Accept your grief, accept it is grief and then mindfully move ahead. I have time for lunch Friday and I would love to take you to lunch. Also, the Merry Widow was crap.

Bernie is a dream straw man!  He would also be an awesome Veep.  I have been having the time of my life, literally.  I did not know I could be this happy.  I realize now, how paralyzingly sad I was for too long.  I remember living in Boston and working 80 hours a week.  Then YOU rescued me from work!!!  I never looked back. I hope work is good.  Are you mostly with Izzy?  What are your days like?  I really want to know what your life is like!  Hey, also, will you meet me in NJ for Aaron's graduation?  Also, Nathan's Bar Mitzvah is Memorial Day Weekend!  I'm getting the plane tickets and you can visit Liz, Marc, etc.  just book early and get a reasonable fare.  I am struggling a little to save for Ben's wedding!\nCan you believe sweet adorable Nathan is turning 13.  So far, he is as delightful and sweet as ever.  I think he is as adorable as you. Can't scrub the cute off of him.  M - life's been weird and hard but in time we are going to have a blast!  I know it.  I need to just breathe and stop having my guard up.  I did not realize how damaged I am.  Not beyond repair and I'm doing some hard work on fixing my poor little self- actually, I am so much stronger than I thought!!  I'm leaving for PSP Monday for a whole week of Solitude!!  I started an oil painting... I can paint! Check it out-  it's not finished but Dawn knew right away it's the view from her lake house!  I love you darling daughter!!  Let me know more about what your days are like- in detail.  I hope Izzy is getting stronger every day!  She is so lucky to have you in her life!  xox, mom",

I knew for the last two years that the day would come when I would be grateful that I am divorced and no longer related to Dad, Ruthy and Merle.  I don't think you need to feel regret or shame about what you choose about who you keep. I hope in time we will restore the good & fun in OUR relationships.  I don't take it for granted that things will ever be normal... Take the time you need.  I'll be right here.  I am happier than I thought was possible.  Loving my print shop & being creative, connecting with friends, and GOOD family... and in love, with a truly wonderful human being.  Brian and I have been together for six months.  It may not seem long, but it's deep.  \nI went through a very rough few years & survived.  I think I was very depressed for a very long time.  I'm so sorry I was not always Mom #1- I did my best, I put you first, as much as I could, I hoped.\nI love you and I miss you.  My life is overflowing with good things and I am not needing much, just wanting to be a family.\nI made reservations for May 26-31 SFO.  Nathan's Bar Mitzvah will be just immediate family, no party- I don't think it is 'optional'. Make plane reservations soon if you want me to pay for your tickets.  Miriam, if you choose to opt out, your call.  Your absence will be a gaping loss, not for me, make your own excuses to Gil and Helen soon, they are expecting you.  I will not 'regret' for you. \nSorry if texts don't strike the right tone.  It is very hard to do that.\nI love you- always will, I deserve to be happy now.  I Didn't need to hear the happy news about Dad how and when I did...  I had company, now I know how it feels when the information that doesn't relate to me arrives unexpectedly.  Please try to protect ME now.  Love, mom",

If you really want your therapist to help, start by attempting to address the position of the 'other.'  Read your words AND mine.  Judge for yourself if you are doing that. Also, try to understand how much I don't want to live in the past.  \n\nAbout the depositions:  I KNOW with certainty that I did not want you to read them.  I simply did not want to create intrigue by refusing you the option.  THAT's why Molly tried hard to discourage you.  I told her to and I know what she said to you. That said, I think in the end as bad as they were, you might have imagined worse.  I am exhausted, on an antibiotic, I have a fever...  When you are ready, we can talk but I expect honesty.

Is it starting to be/feel like almost April?\nMiss you, mom\nPS: I was thinking about Laura today.  Wondering how she is doing.  Please say hello to her from me.",

Choosing to do the MSW was a long process, but it basically came down to really wanting a clinical degree because of how much I love the direct care work I'm doing,  but balancing that against the time commitment, cost, and flexibility of different degrees. I always thought if I did a clinical thing it would be speech, but I think social work actually fits my interests a lot better and is a lot more flexible in terms of what you can do with it.

I got hurt at work (low back and hip) and while workers comp will pay for a PT, I've found a chiropractor that's really helping, but the workers comp won't cover it. I would want to go twice a week for 4 weeks, which adds up to about $600. I really want to be independent, but thinking about spending that much when I'm about to go to grad school and I'm only making $13 an hour is making me so anxious. I am wondering if you could help me pay for t? I really want to get better bc right now it hurts to walk and bike and I'm really frustrated.

I know how hard you work and I remember how much I appreciated it when I/we were struggling and Bubbe&Papa and Dad&Nancy helped out.  I know now that it's much harder to ask than it is for parents to give.  I appreciate what a struggle it is to ask-  I never want it to be hard for you to ask me - i will be honest and tell you if I can't afford something or I think your need shouldn't be my priority- or if I just don't have what you need.  Your health, happiness and education are always going to be my main priorities... I am slowly figuring out my own budgeting and adjusting my priorities:  i am prioritizing good experiences-  like getting Paul Simon & Bob Dylan tix at Ravinia... Ballet, opera, friends... I drove Lori to the airport at 3 am this morning so she could make it to Missy's ultrasound!  it is a very good experience to feel like I can help a friend or you.  I always like being there for my family and friends, money, time ... (Aren't they the same??) You don't understand now, but one day you will...  Sorry so corny,  it's hard to get it right in texts but I have to go out again and wanted to tell you that $600 is no big deal for me but if you risked asking... I worry that you will struggle unnecessarily...Oy, am I saying this wrong???  Mostly, I love you and am very proud of your choices- even though the pay sucks!  Much love,\nNitza",

   "Message": "Yay, I'm so happy Liz is visiting. Me- lying in bed in California...thinking about you....  realize that the ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY BEST THING for my low back pain once I was not immediately post trauma was Pilates!!!\nYoga has too much twisting.\n\nYour body awareness is going to help a lot.  Core stability is the trick... Try lying on a rug- (not a sticky mat) Slightly bent knees pull your belly button toward your spine and keep as much of your spine connected to the floor.  Your PT is probably doing this.  I had a PT that was a Pilates instructor.\n\nYou probably don't remember when you were 4 and I was in a crash (rear ended by a 16 year old). I walked away from the accident but could not move or straighten comfortably for about 6 weeks.  \n\nOh,  Arnica gel works topically.  Something called Traumeel- from whole foods is soothing,  'icy hot' is good but I think the Arnica (also in Traumeel) is the good homeopathic stuff.\n\nIcing:good... Heat, not so good.\n\nUltrasound... Very nice.  Massage... Fantastic but not with a still inflamed spine.  \n\nBut really, it's the Pilates that helped the most.\n\nSorry to say, I revisit the low-back pain issue pretty often and always go to Pilates for relief.\n\nSorry so long... Thinking about you.\n\nAlso, I think if you are in pain still you should talk to a neurologist or a physiatrist and get an MRI.  I have a long- story about why... The gist is, I found out years later that I actually injured my spine and not just a disc.  The spine healed a little brittle/rough which later can manifest as 'traumatic arthritis' when you are 50+... Ha ha, so I still do Pilates.\n\nI LOVE getting an occasional reflexology massage at the Chinese foot spa.  They must have those near you...\n\nOK, call me if u have questions... I have a question:  how fit this happen?????",

He nailed every word of service/Torah-haftorah reading/ it was awesome!!  Ben and Sophie had an uf-ruf. In the first Aliya, it was very joyful.  The service was beautiful- long- but so haimish!  You would have loved being here and you were missed.  I like to think if you weren't injured on top of stressed you would have come.  It is just good and good for me to be here.  Life goes on- it's actually better.  I was miserable at Jacob's Bar Mitzvah and I got sick after... I should have been savoring my nephew's family... Now that I see how joyful I can be I'm sure I was unhappy then- I was drowning and I didn't know it.  Oy.  This all very healing though!  Knowing that I am capable of joy is something.  If you call Nathan to congratulate him you can honestly say you heard that he brought the house down!!!  Honestly, I am always impressed when a Bar Mitzvah kid takes it seriously, but as you might imagine, Nathan put sweetness and humor in as well! \nAll in all, I am having a blast here and in Chicago.  Just enjoying the enjoyment...  still, concerned that you should take care of yourself.  You hear it all the time flexibility is good but may be bad in this low back pain situation. belly button-to-spine exercises will feel the best, I think... From my experience.\nI MISS you.

I want to get the student health insurance through my school because it is way more comprehensive than what I have now. But, it's costs $2900 for the year.

I was planning on sending you a check for $5K that will cover both and a few foot massages... \nI don't know how you are going to manage... But happy that you seem to have it figured out.\nTexting is fine because it's hard to ask, I know.  \n\nBubbe and Papa have been very generous but I think that Grandma Nancy and Zayde are in a better financial position to handle a few extras if you need them.  Also, I asked Zayde to intervene with Dad when I thought he denied a reasonable request for a medical expense- since I was feeling tapped out.  Also, I had a brief conversation with dad about being more supportive of you 3.  He seems to want to be there for you- he said you spoke to him.  I did not say anything about any of you, other than to tell him that money is very fraught in our family and he should try to be helpful without strings.\n\nFYI-  dad may imply that I have lotsa money.  I can share my financial situation with you so you know what my limits are.  I always have a house to sell, but I don't want to do it under financial stress.  \n\nI know you don't want strings  so I'll wait to ask you to visit this summer before school... Just putting the bug in your ear.  The AC is awesome!!!  The house is fantastically comfortable and fun.  Maybe Aaron can come- and Ben is here.  \n\nHow cool are all 3 of you??  Can you believe Aaron??\n\nI would love to talk... Maybe if money is just money- we can get on track...  you will support your kids one day and understand.\n\nI am so proud of what you are taking on.  Also how independent you are trying to be.  I really want you to be safe, happy, healthy...  I'll always have your back...  \n\nOK... Think about a short vacation in a beautiful bed & breakfast in Glencoe... You will not recognize the house.  It's all fixed and so nice.  We can go to the foot spa and get mani-pedis... No Loehman's though, and I never go to Anthropology on my own...  Help?\n\nxoxoxo, n\n\nPS: have so much to tell you and I want to hear more details about you.",

Anyway, I miss you.����One week til your birthday!����I'm sending a little package, I may send it 'signature required'. Is that a problem?����If so, is there a secure place to send it?����Love, mom",

   "Message": "To our beloved community,\n\nOne week ago our home was����destroyed by a fire. We were uncertain about our future in the short and long term. We were grieving the loss of a place that was the literal home to 4 people, and the spiritual home hundreds for the past 11 years. \n\nIf we weren't so confident about the strength, resilience, and staying power of our community������we'd be surprised to share all the amazing things we have accomplished together over the last week. But we are Moishe Kavod House, so we're not surprised at all. What we are is moved beyond words by the kindness, generosity, and competence of our community. What we know now beyond any doubt is that the Moishe Kavod community is so much more than a house. We know that from the hundreds of calls, emails, and Facebook posts from within our community offering to help us rebuild. And we know that from the outreach we have received from dozens of other communities in Boston and nationally who want to help us rebuild because they see us as a vital part of the Jewish and social justice communities. \n\nHere is just a snapshot of what we've done in the last 7 days. There's so much more to do, and while the task ahead seems daunting, we hope when you look at what we've accomplished in just a week you feel as hopeful as we do. \n\n--we have raised several thousand dollars towards the cost of rebuilding, but we need a lot more. Please share this youcaring.com/kavodhouse page far and wide (to help with fundraising or with questions, reach out to Nina Robinson) \n\n--we were happily inundated in offers of help for things like cars, furniture, storage and schlepping, we set up a system for anyone who wants to help to offer their support. Please add yourself here if you want to be part of the rebuilding process in any capacity at all. \n\n--we provided for the emergency needs, shelter, laundry and support for all of our residents \n\n--we convened an initial emergency team that met around the clock to ensure we were coordinated and ready to mobilize the community in the right directions to help\n\n--we returned to the house on Winthrop to gather what remained of our belongings \n\n-- the initial emergency team came up with a strategy to build our capacity by creating a team of coordinators to manage each aspect of our rebuilding process (if you want to know more about that reach out to Miriam Zisook) \n--we have managed to gather and be together and continue to plan Shabbats and activities together. We will be gathering for Shabbat August 5 at 6:30 at the Boston Workmen's Circle! (To plug into this effort contact Sarah Langer) \n\n--we have begun to consider what kinds of rituals we need to heal and move forward. We'll begin with a gathering for Rosh Chodesh Av Sunday evening at 7:00 at 47 Prince St. (If you want tot be part of thinking about other rituals please connect with Mimi Micner)\n\n��� we are especially relieved to share that WE HAVE FOUND A HOME for the coming year. We don't know yet if it will be our new long-term home, but we are excited to spend the coming year there as we look to the����future (if you want to be involved in the process of gathering the things we need and helping us move in, reach out to Rowan van Ness) \n\nThank you to everyone who has participated in these efforts and who has reached out to help! \n\nWith love,\nMoishe Kavod Community Leaders and housemates",

I observed that yes, you were mean. YOU WERE! You arrived in Palm Springs with a chip on your shoulder and acted like you were greatly inconvenienced being there.  Enough already!!!  You are being mean to me now-  all your talk about your 'safety' is insulting.  What good do you expect to come of it??  \n\nI look forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Considering your unenthusiastic reception, I will not bring Brian.  I had hoped that you would be happy for me-  and eager to spend in MY home (yes, your childhood home- that you haven't lived in for 8 years... AND IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHERE YOU GREW UP) and a lovely new person who may be part of my life for a while.    \n\nMiriam, I have boundaries too, I will be cordial tomorrow, but I am not unlimited in my tolerance for rudeness.\nI know time will heal us-  I need to assert myself because I can't be pick-on-mommy forever.  I am not the problem.  I am proud of my conduct over many hideous months.  I had a few lapses; under the circumstances, you might consider being kinder and more forgiving.  \n\nTexting is hard.  Please read as I intended, with respect & love.\n\nI hope you have a blast at Eleanor's wedding!!  Enjoy\n\nI love you. Mom",

Sophie, I'm sorry, it has been my policy to include you as a sibling... \n_���\n\n\n_���\n\n\n_���\nOK- so, Ben, if you would bother to call back I could say something in person...  I called you about Oliver- and came to his rescue- I am always there for you... \nya think you could at least call about my boyfriend after BRAIN SURGERY?!!!  It has been a week!!!\nI am seethingly disappointed with every right to be...  don't get mad about me ranting...  I'm sure if you called and said 'hi mom' in your sweet Ben voice, I would be nicer...\nWho raised you??  I thought I did a better job!!\nDoes consideration have to be something you shower on everyone but me?  So, what am I supposed to do??honestly, why do I bother to provide you all with phones?i think it's time you took those over... get a family plan among yourselves!!! I mean it, at least I won't have to get upset when the phone bills come... don't do it to punish me, I am asking you to do it by the end of January.  Let me know when that's done and I will cancel you off my plan.\nI can't just tolerate this sort of neglect and disdain... and pay for it.  It is unacceptable behavior and I wouldn't tolerate it in strangers...  \nI think I told you ALL at different times that I do not have unlimited tolerance for inconsideration.  Ben, I'm sharing with Sophie and your siblings because I know you will say something and talk about this among yourselves... have at it!!  Try to blame me... all 3 of you could have stepped up- if you didn't want to talk, a get well card would have worked, or a pizza delivery... I love Brian, it's been hard seeing him go through this-  the mailman asked about him... that made me cry because my kids didn't!!! So step up, or I will just give up... you will not have an all access pass to one of the best mothers/friends you will ever have the pleasure to know...\nBTW, my friends, neighbors, Brian's friends & family, doctors, nurses, total strangers have been kind.  There is no lack of kindness and care-  except from the people from whom I need it most.  So, there... maybe you should call...  Miriam, have fun picking me apart with your therapist!  I guess you couldn't bother to actually set goals and parameters for your invasion of my privacy.  So kids, together, or apart, you have to do some soul searching.  If you want me in your life, I'm here, I'll always be here, I'm not sure how present I will be.  \nLove, \nMom\nPS:  if I sound rough, I am hurt & sleep deprived... not my usual gracious kind considerate self!!  I think I remember giving you advice about communicating and setting expectations when friends disappoint you.  I guess our family is different.  I tried...",

Would you like me to help YOU in any way?  Is there anything I can do to lighten your load?  I can get in the car and be there in 14 hours.  Or fly & rent a car.  If you need boots on the ground, I have nothing going on here that I can't leave.  \nI know the $costs will be high and you'll miss school/work- and I want you to be able to step in as needed, so I'll help: consider your airfare/travel/car rental covered- and other incidentals.  It could get expensive- don't worry.  A little extra won't make a difference to me and I know it could potentially relieve a lot of stress for you. \n.\nI don't want to overwhelm Laura but I do want her to know how much I love and support her.\n.\nI would like to be there if there is a memorial or funeral-  that's what I would do normally to honor Laura and Jack.  I imagine that you are in touch with Peggy, Kay Rossiter, Kris Grant-  if you want me to call anyone, please let me know.\nThank you for reaching out to tell me.  I know you are always a wonderful friend to Laura.\nLove, mom",

If I can do anything ask me-  I'm fairly good at helping without being an added burden or obtrusive- so if Laura is overwhelmed she can ask me-  I think Jack was catholic- will there be any of the catholic stuff... does Laura know how he wanted his eventual send off to be?  You are so young to be thinking about these things-  Laura has had so much loss, still it sometimes takes a few years for thoughts of mortality - you get the hang of it after a attending 50+ years of life cycle events... I would rather talk than write but wanted you to know that I'm thinking of you and struggling to find a way to make Laura feel embraced, not just by me, but by her (and Jack's) Glencoe family.",

They had been in a fight and were not talking.  Whenever I argued with papa she would scold me and make me fix the problem because she had regrets... statistically, I'm more likely to go-  I could get hit by a car (stranger things have happened). But if something happened to you I would be sad for the rest of my life that we lost 3 years.  Like I keep saying-  I can't write in the tone I would speak but seriously, nothing is more precious than the moments we could be having planning a wedding, or even mourning a loss...  you are my only daughter, I only get these moments once.  I am committed to making things right.  I honestly don't understand why there is no slack in our relationship when I am basically a very decent person who had a very shitty few years.  I understand where you are coming from but I still can't understand why the response has been so harsh and seemingly punitive.  I'm hurt every time you don't respond to a text, email... never mind phone calls...  are you aware that your silences are so hurtful?  Please try to see all of this from my perspective.  I offered to come to Boston, the offer is back on the table now that Brian is making a good recovery.  It will be tricky to travel for some other reasons but I'll be there on the date & time you say-  even if I have Rufus Wainright tickets!  Or skip Boston- go to Harry Potter World with me!!!

I simply need to send a clear message that I think you are being unkind and I do not wish to have my feelings trampled on a regular and recurring basis.\nI have been very generous from the goodness of my heart- you might consider adjusting your tone accordingly.  \nAs I've said before, basic courtesy is an expectation I have in all of my relationships.  If the roles were reversed, would you continue to gift me? Would paying a phone bill for an unappreciative adult make you feel the slightest bit taken advantage of?  \nI have chosen to pay your phone bill for many years: have you thanked me by returning calls or texts?  Is it appropriate for me to keep you on a 'family' phone plan if you do not treat me like family?  What can I say??  You are an adult.  \nIt costs me about $35-40 per month for your phone line.  It may not seem like much, but I prefer to go to lunch with a friend or get my toes done if it makes no difference to you.  Perhaps it's true that who pays the phone bill will not change your phone etiquette.  Maybe working a few extra hours a month will make you  more appreciative of the bigger sacrifices I have made so that you could have nice things like clothes, yoga & health insurance.  I recently sent you a book, just because I thought it would make you laugh... you could have texted... \nI often think of sending you things that I think you would enjoy, why???  I have so much to offer you- how can you not see what a resource I am for you??  You have NOT made an effort to get to know who I really am- now that I don't live in a state of constant anxiety.\nI may not be perfect, but I'm as good a mother as you will ever have.  I have, and will always put your needs ahead of my own.  I have some skin in this game; I would like to have a nice relationship with my baby-girl but I also SINCERELY think YOU WILL BE HAPPIER IF YOU ARE A MORE RESPECTFUL DAUGHTER!!!  Why put yourself through what you must be feeling??\nI'm sorry you are not now able to approach our relationship with more trust & understanding.  I honestly don't know what could be eating you, or if you have personal issues that keep you from being nicer...  I hope you are happy and thriving.  I would like to hear about good things in your life and I would like to share my joys with you.  I feel the loss of YOU daily.  \nThere are many happy celebrations in OUR near future... why not just move on?  Is it worth it to YOU to miss out on these precious days when I'm young-ish- and able to travel to see you? What will you accomplish? Is it your intention to erode my confidence that you will one day be a loving daughter?  Is it really your perception that I gave you enough of a reason to give up?  You can keep trying to convince me that your behavior toward me is is warranted under the circumstances, but frankly, we both know it is NOT.  Years of cold, including times when we both needed each other, are quite enough for me to have learned whatever lesson you were attempting to teach me.\nAgain, what do YOU want to accomplish and what do YOU think my expectations should be??  \nIt has been over a year since we spoke... how do you see this hideous situation evolving?? Will you come for Pesach? Sophie's Shower?? Can we be joyful together at Ben & Sophie's wedding?  WILL YOU RAIN ON THOSE DAYS??? Can you see a path to 'detente' where we are at least cordial & I can ask you what classes you are taking... how your volunteering is... how your friends are... just the day to day things... \nHow many times or ways can I tell you that our relationship is important to me. Your behavior sends a message; is it your intention to tell ME that I am unimportant?  \nAgain, I just don't know what I can do.  I think I have a lot to offer you but if you prefer to carry on without me- I will invest my energy and resources (eg: $40/month & my energy in trying to engage positively) where they will be put to good use.\nKindest regards, mom\nPS:  still hard to get the tone right by text... but I keep trying...",

I can't get my arms around how angry you are about something that could be excused under the 'she was grieving, upset, abused, undermined, unloved... '. If I were you I would be thinking wow, my mom almost kept it together under the harshest of circumstances... she must be pretty capable...  \nI wish I could get some credit for being snack-mom instead of dwelling on whatever nastiness you perceive where none was intended.  People don't ask you how your mom is on a daily basis... you can probably go days without thinking about me... I have to revisit the pain of your mistrust on a daily basis.  \nSince you may not have been reading my cues\nI really think that whatever message you have tried to send, you have crossed the line. I feel punished enough.  Not talking to a loved one is never a good thing.  \nWe both made mistakes in the last three years.  We have an opportunity to have a wonderful relationship- we are alike in some ways, different in others.  I've learned a lot about myself- I am not quite the same.  I can't un-tell you things...let's just start somewhere.  How is your life?  How's school?  Are you still involved with Kavod?  How did the aftermath of the fire work out? How is the new house?  On my end, I'm very much enjoying myself.  Starting to catch wedding fever... interested in your input.  Planning on PSP in March.  I cleaned out the basement- for real...  Brian is almost recovered from surgery and the tremor is gone- miraculous.  I would love to have a chance to be the mom you need and deserve.\nxox, mom\nPS: did you get the Regretsy book??  I got one for me too. It came yesterday... I'm Plotzing.",

It would be nice for you to come for Pesach...  we have not been together for Pesach for a long time-  you know how important that is for me.

Setting parameters is between you and your therapist, you can set whatever you want as off limits with him. I think our therapists can help us find a way to get to the heart of what we each need from each other.",

Is this something your therapist is suggesting?  Can you provide a focus for the discussion?  It feels to me like an invasion of my private relationship with my therapists and a lack of trust in my ability to relate to you on my own. I also think you are asking for control of my relationship with my therapists-  and not trying to see this all from my perspective.  \n\nIs there something that you are not able to tell me, or ask for directly?  \n\nPlease, Miriam.  I am going to be away for two weeks now, so nothing can happen quickly.  I would like you to come for Pesach/showers/wedding... do you want to miss these moments?\n\nLove, mom\n\nI think we both need to compromise here...

I wasn't going to tell you, but at the risk of TMI... Dad's therapist ... remember those stories??? was unlicensed.  I know nothing about your therapist, their training, their approach.  You know nothing about mine.  If two professionals were to talk, I would prefer to know that your therapist is licensed and where they received their training.  \nThere are too many reasons that this is a fraught situation for me.  Use your intuition...  I spent 18 months in a divorce where I never said one word to my husband.  The result was -a divorce-  what happens AFTER the therapists talk?  Have you thought this through and have you weighed the risks and benefits to US??  I keep asking you to tell me why this is important.  Your answer so far has been 'because It's what I want...' since Dad left I have been in the business of placating you. I have indulged you in two years of what I consider to be unkind behavior that I DO NOT DESERVE.  If you are trying to test my assertiveness, bravo! I have some dignity left.  That said, I see a therapist and an MD.  I spoke to Dr. gutman and she has agreed to mediate this situation because she knows you.  I continue to see her and she is as good as they get.  (You don't have much respect for her, you've told me, but she was wonderful asset to our family for over 25 years.  I don't see my Clinical Psychologist quite as often as I used to anyway-  I can't afford to - I am not in clinic on a sliding scale-  please return to me with a plan for your therapist to have a conversation with Dr. G so I can make back to back appointments.  I expect you will want to do the same.\nGuess what- I inconveniently delayed my trip to PSP for you... and I'm leaving for Tuscon, PSP on Tuesday for 10 days.  I believe you have Dr. g's contact info.  You can arrange to have the therapist-summit...\nFYI, I'm happy about most, if not every thing in my life, except this.  Why wouldn't you summon the heroic daughter who risked the unknown to support me when Dad left?  What happened??  Sorry if this is causing you anxiety.  Life is full of stress and anxiety... 'there is a crack, a crack, in everything... that's how the light gets in'. \nCome what may.  I can handle it all, I just don't want you to miss all the wedding planning fun, and I don't want this issue clouding the happy times ahead... all I ask is that you take the position of 'the other' in this situation.  Is your therapist advising you to play 'chicken' with me??  \nHow is your back?  Are you keeping up with PT$?\nLovelovelove, mom",
